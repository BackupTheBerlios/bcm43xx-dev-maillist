I got on this idea because I logged all PCI configuration read/write
values and discovered that the Broadcom wl driver did a read/write on
this location. A later examination of the open-source part of that
driver showed that they copied it from ipw2100. If anyone knows the
layout of the private area of the configuration space, they should;
however, they may be just propagating the code as you say.

This change does not fix the DMA error problem with Atom processors in
Netbooks. We have had one report of DMA errors in a Core Duo system -
AFAIK, the only non-Atom processor with the problem. That user has not
tested this patch.
