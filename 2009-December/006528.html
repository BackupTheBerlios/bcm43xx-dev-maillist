HP and IBM/Lenovo both have BIOS checks for particular PCI IDs and
only allow cards with certain IDs to be plugged in.

Sorry, no idea.

Check that the expansion socket is compatible. The 4318 is probably a
mini-PCI card and .11n cards are usually mini-PCIe which is very
different and not at all compatible. The card you buy must fit your
socket. I've bought an Atheros miniPCI .11n card off eBay for my X40:

<A HREF="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=400078624952">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=400078624952</A>

But I haven't received it yet so I can't review. It's supposed to be
supported by ath9k. I expect that I have to fiddle with the EEPROM on
this card to get my ThinkPad to boot with it.

Also check the antenna situation. .11n often uses MIMO so it might
need an extra antenna to be installed in your laptop. Note how the
above card has three connectors, and comes shipped with one antenna.
Also note the MIMO arrangement so that it fits your needs. (In
simplified terms it can be optimized for receive or transmit.)
