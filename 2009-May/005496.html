I also started with LDD3, but I quickly found that the kernel had
changed in a few places since the book was written, and that the most
efficient way to progress was to start writing code.

Start with the really simple examples, simple devices, simple fake
devices, and progress one step at a time.

I would not recommend choosing a wifi driver as the first project.
It will fail or take unneccessarily long to finish.

Really, use the source. Look at existing drivers. Duplicate them.
Tweak them. Break them. Learn from them.

Try writing some code of your own. Tweak it. Break it. Learn from it.

Repeat until done. Oh, and you should be decent with the C language,
and knowing the userspace APIs naturally help when working on the
&quot;other&quot; side.
