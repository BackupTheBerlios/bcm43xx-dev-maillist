Of course, I will always be available to give advise and help on the technical details.
With the recent merge of the PHY abstraction in b43 it shouldn't be that hard
anymore to understand the basics of the code. I think stuff is clearly modulised now
and fairly easy to understand, after you once understood the basics of the device.

So for implementing N-PHY, you'll basically work inside of the phy_n.c and
phy_n.h files only (maybe 98% of the work will be there).

So, you could probably look into phy_g.c to get an idea of how this could probably
look like.

Please contact us before you start writing patches, so we can give some additional
advise on coding conventions used in the driver.

Greetings, Michael.
