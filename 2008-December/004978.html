</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Matthew
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I still don't think its a general problem, but a problem that b43legacy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does miss something bcm43xx does to initialize my hardware to enable it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We cannot enable the radio from within the driver, if it's hardware
</I>&gt;<i> disabled. We cannot do this in b43legacy and we cannot do this in bcm43xx.
</I>&gt;<i> Fullstop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>With all due respect Michael, if it has been disabled by the panel switch such 
as the one on my lappy, can it not be made to emit such an error message so 
that we know we have to toggle that pushbutton?  On my HP- dv5120us, there is 
no tactile feel, or any other means to determine the state of this switch, an 
apparently push-push switch.  The LED is no help cuz you can and do turn it 
on and off at will regardless of the state of the switch.  Having to push the 
button and reboot to see if that fixes it doesn't seem like a very productive 
way to spend an evening.  So I give up and plug in a cable, hundreds of times 
faster to get a network connection, or if on the road, to borrow a little 
dlink tranceiver from the motel.  That after all, is the target condition we 
are trying to achieve.

&gt;<i>If it fails now and didn't fail earlier, it almost certainly is something
</I>&gt;<i>_else_ that disables the rf.
</I>&gt;<i>Please make sure _all_ dell related kernel modules are loaded
</I>&gt;<i>and all dell related kernel options are enabled (there are quite a few).
</I>&gt;<i>And try to use the dell-tool that was suggested earlier in the thread.
