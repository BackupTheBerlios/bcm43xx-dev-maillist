Ok it works now, but dont ask why, Im just scrutinizing it
I need kernel 2.6.27.9 for b43legacy, 2.6.22 for bcm43xx, kernels in 
between just hang on loading the modules.

Multiple reboots and hangs later I think I have 3 different bugs to deal
with:

Bug#1: If I load the modules ( b43legacy or bcm43xx) togehter with b44
(my  network device sitting on the mainboard) the system hangs hard.
Unfortionatly this was done in the ubuntu ramdisk -until I disabled it

This happens after initializing ssb wich in tune autoloads the other
modules. Just after the  second module initializes even sysreq does not
show up anymore. I find this from  2.6.23 onward.
At manually inserting the b44 after b43legacy  I got following error 
message on console:
sbb: FATAL ERROR bus powered down while accessing PCI MMIO space
the message repeated infinitly until I hit poweroff - sysreq was not 
working.

I can get away from this for testing if I prevent modprobe from seeing
more than one  of bcm43xx.ko b43legacy.ko or b44.ko e.g. by renaming them.

tell me what information you need to track this one down...

Bug#2: something is disabling the rfkill line on my minipci card slot

@Michael Buesch: You were indeed right! Somewhere between 2.6.22 and
current the rfkill gets switched on on my laptop, I presume by some new
acpi or wmi initializing function.

The bcm4301 module is on a mini-pci card and pin 13 is the rfkill switch
input signal. The people of the madwifi project have some info about
this on their web site and they say &quot;put selotape on this pin if nothing
else works&quot;. I did so and i could see rfkill/../state=0 with selotape 
and rfkill/../state=1 without.

BUT: in my current configurateion the UNMODIFIED driver is happy with it !!
At least did not bring the &quot;hardware disabled&quot; message anymore and is 
happily transmitting in either state.
I had them messages before, and I will look for what caused the 
difference in my configuration.

@Matthew Garret: I commented ou the vendor match of dell-laptop.c
(becaus my dmi sais &quot;Dell Computer Corporation&quot;) and tried it, it loads,
but rfkill is not registered and toggeling the backlight has no effect. 
so I unloaded it.

But either the dbcbas patch or the wmi interface enabled my backlight 
toggling. Now I get fancy symbol messages on gnome if I hit the buttons 
of backlight and volume.

Bug#3:
I said I could associate but not send packets. No wonder if you get the 
web key wrong by just one digit. But there was not a single error 
message about it. just found it while diffing some command output. *GRR*

bye
Ulf
