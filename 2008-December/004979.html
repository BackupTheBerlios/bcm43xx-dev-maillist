We emit a message that the radio is disabled.
The b43 driver has exactly one read-only bit to determine whether the radio
is on or off. It polls that bit every second and displays a message when it
got toggled.
That's all we can do from within the driver.

_If_ you can switch it by software, which is theoretically possible of course,
then _not_ through the broadcom wireless PCI device. It has to be done through
another device. So you must load the driver for that device and switch the signal.

I think you should send this to HP.
I really can't do anything about it. All I have is one single read-only bit.
