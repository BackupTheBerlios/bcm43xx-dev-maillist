Right.

&gt;<i> So when I added the flag it meant:

</I>
Yeah, but the assumption that software can change the &quot;hardware kill
state&quot; is rather stupid to start with, I think.

&gt;<i> So basically it means the device has two states. One software state and one hardware
</I>&gt;<i> state.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I don't know what the semantics for the flag are today. Lots of code changed.
</I>
Ok. I think the fundamental flaw here is assuming that there's just a
single state. There isn't. The device can be turned off in hardware (in
which case sw won't be able do anything about it, but we want to know)
or in software (which we want to handle). Pretending that there's just a
single state that's either hw-off, sw-off or on is plain wrong. The
device can be hw-off and sw-off at the same time, and then if you turn
off the hw-off button it won't turn on (however, unless your system
integrator totally screwed up, you won't have a hw and a sw button on
your system)
