<PRE>[warning: this is going to be a long mail and will tell you why and how
I think rfkill needs to be rewritten]

I'd suggest to start by rewriting rfkill to be not such a mess to use.

We really need to disentangle the state tracking rfkill does. People
have said this a million times before, but nobody cares: drivers need to
register hard-blocked and get soft-block states independently, not in a
single enum; API for drivers needs to be, above all, EASY to use.

For mac80211, we really need to register an rfkill structure for each
physical device that mac80211 knows about. Drivers would not be allowed
to get access to this structure, because the toggle_radio() callback is
assigned to a mac80211 function that calls the driver's -&gt;config()
callback and, at some point, also disallows configuring interfaces that
belong to a device that is rfkilled.

To properly implement this, however, we need to disentangle rfkill
states and provide just a single API function to change the state:

rfkill_hw_kill(struct rfkill *rfkill, bool killed);

this would be shadowed by mac80211 with
	ieee80211_hw_rfkill(struct ieee80211_hw *hw, bool killed)
so mac80211 knows about hard-kills too, since they don't call
-&gt;toggle_radio() obviously.

I know what you're thinking at this point, but hear me out. This is
another thing where I think rfkill's design is fundamentally wrong. If
you're not thinking anything, hear me out anyway :)


Let's take a step back here and analyse what we really have and need:

 * we have devices with a plethora of rfkill setups:
   1) devices disappear from the bus (not handled here, not possible
      either)
   2) devices have hard kill button that just disables the radio
      (need to know about this so users aren't left in the dark)
   3) devices have soft kill buttons that just notify the driver
   4) soft kill switches that work through other input methods (ACPI
      comes to mind, but anything is possible)
 * we have various ways to kill the radio:
   1) like above
   2) through platform methods (toshiba ACPI I think?)
   3) through the driver only

The last two cases only differ in the radios that the button is supposed
to apply to, but this is more of a policy decision.

The point where I think rfkill's design is totally wrong is that it
intimately ties this software kill from case three to the rfkill
structure as well.

Instead, we should come to accept that this is just a button as well. A
button, however, that is *by default* tied to a particular radio.
Therefore, drivers for devices that provide such buttons, should, in my
opinion, register an rfkill button driver that
 a) by default is tied to their hardware by a pointer to the rfkill
    struct for the hardware, but this could be possible to override in
    sysfs like LEDs are, if you want the button to really kill all
    radios
 b) serves as input to the rfkill subsystem which will then look up the
    right rfkill struct(s) and ask them to kill the radio

This would add new API for a button, but again only a single function,
something like
	rfkill_button_update(struct rfkill_button *btn, bool killed)


Finally, rfkill-input will boil down to just registering a software
button that happens to control all radios by default, by setting the
controlled rfkill struct to NULL.
