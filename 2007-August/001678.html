All of the 'quality' numbers from any program are rather useless. The only thing that matters is how 
much data one can stuff over the airwaves per unit time.

If you have another machine on your LAN, you can use the Iperf package. It comes as client and 
server for almost any machine. My server runs Linux, which makes it easy, but there is a server for 
Windows and OS X. This program transmits a random string of bits across the connection and reports 
the results. On my server at <A HREF="ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.org/patches">ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.org/patches</A> are a couple of Perl scripts that 
test the link at different speeds. One uses an Iperf server, the other copies a file to a server and 
copies it back to get the transfer speed.

If you don't have another machine on your LAN, you are limited to the browser speed tests, whic in 
my case measure the speed of my broadband line - my link is much faster than the line.

On most of the BCM43xx cards that I have seen, the noise level is anywhere from -70 to -90 dBm, 
depending how close you are to the AP, and the general 2.4 GHz noise level of the room. The signal 
level varies from -30 to -60 dBm.

I hope this is clear. If not, please ask questions about the part that isn't.

Larry
