I think there are two problems with the driver when walking away from the AP. The first is that the
driver has not been telling mac80211 that it is time to consider cutting the transfer rate. The
second is that we currently have no means of increasing the transmit power as we move further from
the AP.

A fix for problem #1 is attached. I think I have something for the second, but it needs more testing.
