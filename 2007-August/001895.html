That is scary! That may mean that something is not being reset. The real question is whether warm 
reboots are intrinsically different than cold (power-off) reboots.

</I>
I'm surprised that you get signal values as high as -5 dBm. My maximum is about -35. I'm usually in 
the -40 range, even at 2 m from the AP.

&gt;<i> With the patch applied power is reported as 27dB in debugfs. With

</I>
The CCCK (B) encoding is much different than OFDM (G) transmissions. I would not be surprised to 
learn that its range were longer.

The power setting that comes from mac80211 is 27 dBm, which is completely bogus for what is supposed 
to be the FCC table. The regulatory limit is 20 dBm EIRP (a fancy acronym that means take the 
antenna into account). I've sent a fix for comment, but as is the usual case for mac80211, it will 
take several days or weeks to get a response. The maximum power that a bcm43xx device can use is 
encoded in the sprom. For most of them that quantity is 18.5 dBm, corresponding to the regulatory 
limit of 20 minus a safety factor of 1.5. I think that is there to prevent setting the power too 
high and flunking the certification tests. The output that goes to the radio is thus 18.5 less the 
gain of the antenna, which is also in the sprom with a usual value of 2 dBm. That is why you see the 
code setting a Desired power of 16.5 dBm.

Initially, I thought that the performance of my BCM4311 fell off as the power increased; however, 
that no longer happens. As a result, we can push full power at all times and there seems to be no 
need to use the kind of algorithm that you were testing. Don't tell the FCC, but we could relax that 
upper power limit as we will never try to get the device certified, but then we would use extra 
power, and run the risk of burning out the radio. If you decide to do that, please tell me the power 
setting at which it fried!

With the patches that were pushed into wireless-dev a few minutes ago, I suggest that you try 
bcm43xx-mac80211. It is getting at least as good, if not better, performance than the BCM4301 or the 
softmac port to mac80211 drivers do. We would also appreciate as much testing as possible as it will 
help getting it merged into mainstream. That driver will require V4 firmware.

Thanks for your report,

Larry
