When I first started investigating the problem of mac80211 not reducing the rate as I moved away 
from the AP, it seemed to me that the decision regarding excessive retries should be made in 
mac80211, not in the driver; however, I have had extreme difficulty in getting any changes into 
mac80211 on several occasions. Linville assures me that he has had private discussions about this 
problem; however, I needed a quick fix and couldn't stand any protracted discussion and/or review 
delays. I knew Michael would be tough, but that his comments would not be delayed.

At the moment, I have more pressing matters to resolve than fixing this problem in mac80211; 
however, I feel really good that the port of bcm43xx-softmac to mac80211 has this issue.
