As far as I know, the firmware is never stored in the device
permanently.  It is loaded by the driver into device RAM.  The firmware
has to be extracted by bcm43xx-fwcutter, which can process both v3 and
v4 firmware.
 
&gt;<i> How do i find out my firmware revision?
</I>
It will be reported by bcm43xx-fwcutter

&gt;<i> Will there be support for v4?
</I>
It is is a separate driver, bcm43xx_mac80211.  It's already supported.

&gt;<i> Can i flash the rom to v3 to get support for this driver, and in doing
</I>&gt;<i> so, will it affect the hardware functionality at all?
</I>
As far as I know, you cannot flash ROM.

&gt;<i> I did not see a bcm4311 driver in the kernel (.22 and .23rc1), do i
</I>&gt;<i> need to patch to get it?
</I>
If you mean bcm4301, yes, you need to patch the kernel.  But bcm43xx is
already in the driver, and it works with v3 firmware.
