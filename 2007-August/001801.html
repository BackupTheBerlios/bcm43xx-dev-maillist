So?

I know that this is broken (So we don't hide the bug by removing the
message), but I don't know how to fix it. Is that such an unusual
condition? I simply don't understand how the hardware works.
Sure, we can simply hide the bug by changing the code so that it
doesn't complain anymore.
That's not the issue here. The problem is, that I don't know how
to fix this _correctly_.

So, that said, I'm not sure which lack of communication you are talking
about. I do _not_ know how that stuff works. So, if you want to try
understanding it, read the code and specs and try to make sense out
of it.

I am working on this stuff. I have limited time and I'm not Merlin
the magician. So I have to try understanding this stuff.
