But unlike quilt, you don't have to do anything before editing the
sources.  You can create a patch after the changes are done.  Or you can
revert the changes.

Having to do anything before editing reeks of version control systems
predating CVS, where files had to be checked out for editing.

My complaint about stgit is that I have to write the description without
seeing the changes.  I just noticed &quot;stg new -s&quot;, but it's broken.
Generally, stgit follows quilt too closely here.  &quot;stg new&quot; and &quot;stg
refresh&quot; should be merged, or one of them should be optional.

&gt;<i> Sometimes, I just make patches in quilt, then I do &quot;quilt 
</I>&gt;<i> refresh&quot;, &quot;quilt pop -a&quot;, &quot;cd patches&quot; and modify the patches 
</I>&gt;<i> and series file manually, e.g. by moving one patch from one file 
</I>&gt;<i> into the other. The &quot;cd ..&quot;, &quot;quilt push -a&quot; and off I am. That 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;database&quot; of quilt is in a known format and I can hack on 
</I>&gt;<i> it with an editor is a plus for me :-)
</I>
That's a very cool feature that stgit should learn.

&gt;<i> That said: once I'm finished with quilt-things, I'm using stg 
</I>&gt;<i> import to import this into git and use git to send it off to the 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list. I'm not working with stg on the first place, 
</I>&gt;<i> because quilt is noticably faster than stg.
</I>
Perhaps periodic repacking with git-gc could speed up things a bit.  But
the search for changed files is actually for your protection, and should
be appreciated IMHO.

&gt;<i> *) in stgit I can do &quot;stg refresh -e&quot; to edit the description 
</I>&gt;<i> afterwards
</I>
&quot;stg refresh -es&quot; and &quot;stg export -np&quot; are my favorite commands.

I'm going to post all my ideas to the git list right now.
