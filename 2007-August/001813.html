</I>&gt;<i> It should, but this feature is not yet implemented. I have some test code
</I>&gt;<i> to do this, but it is not ready. When it is, I'll send you a trial patch.
</I>&gt;<i> Check if your system has a file names
</I>&gt;<i> /sys/kernel/debug/bcm43xx/phyX/power_level. If it does, you can write new
</I>&gt;<i> values for the Desired power into it. Values up to 18 are allowed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I see, and thank you for the tip. I thought power_level was read-only.

&gt;<i> &gt; 11M mode is unusable at all distances, 12M works fine. This probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; breaks rate scaling for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it certainly would. My 4311 shows a little dip at 11 Mbs, but not as
</I>&gt;<i> big as yours. Is your AP using b/g mode, or just g mode? What is the make
</I>&gt;<i> and model of the AP?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's a netgear wgt634u, most recent &quot;stable&quot; firmware, configured for B/G.

&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;rmmod bcm43xx&quot; when kde is running hangs rmmod and prevents a clean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shutdown. I tried to find which program causes this while using bcm4301
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; driver, but so far no luck. System shuts down fine if I don't try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rmmod first. rmmod works fine from runlevel 3 aside from this message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when inserting module again:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;net eth1: device_rename: sysfs_create_symlink failed (-17)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On my system, I routinely unload the module using 'modprobe -r bcm43xx'.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes, it happens 20 or 30 times between reboots. These are always at
</I>&gt;<i> runlevel 5. Only once or twice has it not completed. Are you using
</I>&gt;<i> NetworkManager or using the traditional ifup/ifdown methods?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Networkmanager+knetworkmanager. killing these before rmmod doesn't help.

&gt;<i> &gt; Nitpicking:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When changing bitrate manually it will not show up with iwconfig before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any traffic has occured.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a mac80211 problem. My original version of the patch that
</I>&gt;<i> implemented the &quot;set rate&quot; function loaded the new rate so that it would
</I>&gt;<i> show up immediately, but that part was nixed. Complain on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">wireless-dev at vger.kernel.org.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Maybe I will. It's not that big of an issue, but still confusing for those 
unknowing.

&gt;<i> &gt; Sometimes iwconfig link quality shows values in the whole 0-255 range.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do the Signal and Noise levels show -256 dBm at the same time? If so,
</I>&gt;<i> mac80211 has not received any data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sometimes signal fluctuates at the same time, noise is pretty much always 
around -70dBm. I can't recall I've seen it show -256 for this driver.
