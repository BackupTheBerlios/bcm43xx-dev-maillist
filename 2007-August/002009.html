As far as firmware is concerned, it usually doesn't matter whether the driver is for XP or Vista, 
only what version it is. That part of the driver is thrown away and replaced by the Linux driver. In 
fact, the firmware that I'm using came from the MIPS drivers used in OpenWRT. I like them because 
they are small, unlike those humongous Windows drivers, made even worse because you usually have to 
download all sorts of support software.

At the moment, we do not have any specifications on how to drive devices with your revision level. 
That is what the reverse engineers do. They take Broadcom drivers apart, deduce how they work and 
write the specifications. See <A HREF="http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net/Specification">http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net/Specification</A> for examples. The bcm43xx 
developers take those web pages and turn them into code. We do not ever see the details of 
Broadcom's drivers. If we did, we would be open to lawsuits over theft of intellectual property. 
Similarly, the RE's don't touch the Linux-driver code.

If you would like to help with the RE activity, our RE's read this mailing list and will be 
contacting you.
