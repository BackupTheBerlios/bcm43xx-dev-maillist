It turns out that the new port works as well as the current driver, has the ability to adjust the 
transmit rate depending on conditions, and is free of the locking bugs of SoftMAC. There are, of 
course, bugs in mac80211, but at least they will be fixed. There is very little maintenance on SoftMAC.

There will still be 2 drivers as Michael's version with V4 firmware will still be in the development 
tree, and it will be merged to mainstream when ready. As his version will not support 802.11b-only 
devices (no support in that firmware), this port will then be gutted of 802.11g devices. I can 
assure you that this will not happen until the V4 driver functions at least as well as bcm43xx does now.
