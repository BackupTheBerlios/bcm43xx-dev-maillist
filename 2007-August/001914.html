</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Richard,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Please grab a new copy of the port_to_mac80211 patch, and try the patch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; below. It boosts the desired power by up to 5 dBm as signal - noise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decreases from 20 to 0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Larry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hard to say if there is a difference. I've noticed that signal quality
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes between reboots. When I first tried this patch I couldn't get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above 36M even at the AP, so I loaded the version without the patch. Same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing. So I rebooted and then all rates worked, even 11M. Even for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; driver version that didn't work a few days ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is scary! That may mean that something is not being reset. The real
</I>&gt;<i> question is whether warm reboots are intrinsically different than cold
</I>&gt;<i> (power-off) reboots.
</I>
I've power cycled between reboots, unsure if I would get the same results on a 
soft reset.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; New/updated observations:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rate scaling seems to work, but if it gets down to 1M it will not rise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; again unless I force it to a higher bitrate and run iperf for a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seconds before setting it to auto. This is even when signal is -5dBm and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; noise is -80dBm. I get a feeling it's a bit to sensitive as it will drop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quickly at a few meters away. At this distance forced 54M still works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe this is due to small dips (0.5sec) in traffic flow?!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm surprised that you get signal values as high as -5 dBm. My maximum is
</I>&gt;<i> about -35. I'm usually in the -40 range, even at 2 m from the AP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That -5dBm signal is best case when AP's antenna is a few cm from the 
computers lid. In this position it often reads between -15 - -20dBm. If I 
move just a cm further away it drops to -30dBm which gradually decreases with 
distance.

&gt;<i> &gt; With the patch applied power is reported as 27dB in debugfs. With
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debug_xmitpower dmesg reports desired power to be 16.5 and actual 16.25.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is max when I manually set power through debugfs. After a while it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; down to 10dB, even though only 1M works where I sit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Range seems to be higher for B-rates. Maybe this is just how things are,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I lack experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The CCCK (B) encoding is much different than OFDM (G) transmissions. I
</I>&gt;<i> would not be surprised to learn that its range were longer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The power setting that comes from mac80211 is 27 dBm, which is completely
</I>&gt;<i> bogus for what is supposed to be the FCC table. The regulatory limit is 20
</I>&gt;<i> dBm EIRP (a fancy acronym that means take the antenna into account). I've
</I>&gt;<i> sent a fix for comment, but as is the usual case for mac80211, it will take
</I>&gt;<i> several days or weeks to get a response. The maximum power that a bcm43xx
</I>&gt;<i> device can use is encoded in the sprom. For most of them that quantity is
</I>&gt;<i> 18.5 dBm, corresponding to the regulatory limit of 20 minus a safety factor
</I>&gt;<i> of 1.5. I think that is there to prevent setting the power too high and
</I>&gt;<i> flunking the certification tests. The output that goes to the radio is thus
</I>&gt;<i> 18.5 less the gain of the antenna, which is also in the sprom with a usual
</I>&gt;<i> value of 2 dBm. That is why you see the code setting a Desired power of
</I>&gt;<i> 16.5 dBm.
</I>
I see! I expected it to go to 18dBm.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Initially, I thought that the performance of my BCM4311 fell off as the
</I>&gt;<i> power increased; however, that no longer happens. As a result, we can push
</I>&gt;<i> full power at all times and there seems to be no need to use the kind of
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm that you were testing. Don't tell the FCC, but we could relax
</I>
IMHO there should eventually be some power scaling, as I understand wlan takes 
a fair amount of power. Ideally there should be different modes (powersave, 
performance) preferrably as an API common to all networking, at least 
wireless. Getting offtopic, just a thought.

&gt;<i> that upper power limit as we will never try to get the device certified,
</I>&gt;<i> but then we would use extra power, and run the risk of burning out the
</I>&gt;<i> radio. If you decide to do that, please tell me the power setting at which
</I>&gt;<i> it fried!
</I>
Heh, I might have tried if it was a usb stick ;) Since it's usable and since I 
got 54M/36M rate under no/high load in winxp under the same circumstances I 
believe power output is sufficient.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the patches that were pushed into wireless-dev a few minutes ago, I
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that you try bcm43xx-mac80211. It is getting at least as good, if
</I>&gt;<i> not better, performance than the BCM4301 or the softmac port to mac80211
</I>&gt;<i> drivers do. We would also appreciate as much testing as possible as it will
</I>&gt;<i> help getting it merged into mainstream. That driver will require V4
</I>&gt;<i> firmware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your report,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Larry
</I>
Sure, I'll do that. Where do I get a current source? By git?
(I forgot to add the mailinglist in the original mail, sorry)
