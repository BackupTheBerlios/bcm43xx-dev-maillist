Indeed, a few more debug messages would help a lot.  I see
you've just submitted a patch to give some more even when
debug is switched off.  That seems like a really good idea.

&gt;<i> ....

</I>&gt;<i> light on?
</I>
It has both, combined.  Unfortunately it's a push on/push off type
button and you can't see if it's on or off.  I just pushed it
and the light did, indeed, come on and I can now iwlist scan to
see my router and can ping it with the wired network unplugged.

I'm not sure if I should feel really stupid for not trying this
before.  I did try when I started playing with this about a fort-
night ago but in all the messing around it went out of my mind,
particularly as I wasn't sure if it was a real hardware switch
or something that got interpretted by Windows to do the equivalent
of ifconfig up/down or whatever.

It's all not very obvious as you have to have done both an
ifconfig eth1 up and pressed the button to the right state
before you get a blue light.

Anyway, seems to be all working at the driver level.  Thanks
for your help.

Regards,

Ed Davies.
