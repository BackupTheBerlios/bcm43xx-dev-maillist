If you don't want the auto speed adjustment, or are unhappy with it, you can change the rate setting 
with the 'iwconfig eth1 rate Y' command. As your system seems not to auto-scale very well, I would 
try values for Y of 11M, 18M, 24M, 36M, 48M, and 54M (in that order). For each speed, try a ping 
flood against your AP (ping -f 192.168.1.1, or whatever address is shown as the gateway in a 'route 
-n' command). As long as you don't see a lot of dots from the flood, it is safe to try the next 
higher speed. Once you get a failure, you might want to back off one extra speed for safety.

Have you tried changing the AP's channel, if possible? You might find less interference with a 
different setting. Does your location have any other 2.4 GHz devices like portable telephones or 
baby monitors, etc. They could interfere.
