=============================

This patch ports the PHY and radio handling code of the softmac driver
to the mac80211 front end from b43. The resulting driver is known as
b43legacy.

This driver uses V3 firmware and supports 802.11b-only devices (BCM4301
and BCM4303). It also supports the BCM4306/2 802.11g model. This driver
is needed as these units are not supported by the V4 firmware used with
driver b43. Module ssb has been modified to select between b43 and
b43legacy depending on the revision of the 802.11 wireless core. As a
result the two versions can coexist on a system. The scheme whereby
the firmware is split into separate directories precludes any problems
with firmware names. Compilation with both drivers built into the
kernel confirms that there are no namespace collisions between b43 and
b43legacy.

John,

Because of the size of this patch, I have not sent it to the lists.
If this is a problem, please let me know. It is meant to apply to the
b43 branch of wireless-dev after the series of 6 patches queued by
Michael Buesch on Aug. 18.

This patch has been run through scripts/checkpatch.pl, and is reasonably
free of the defects found by that script.

The problem with performance on the BCM4306/2 has been fixed. It still
needs improvement, but it now works as well as it ever has.

Thanks,

Larry
