</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, what is maximum. See the other fixme in that code there where we check

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Look for short vs long retry limit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not that easy to fix, actually.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, I think we should configure the retry limits through cfg80211.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought the firmware did the retries without intervention and would only come back when those were

</I>
The retry counts are not stored in SHM. They are stored in the TX status report.
(The counts in SHM are just debugging stuff)
