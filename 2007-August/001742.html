Agreed. There are definitely problems with getting things into mac80211
and I've complained about that in the past.

&gt;<i> At the moment, I have more pressing matters to resolve than fixing this problem in mac80211; 
</I>&gt;<i> however, I feel really good that the port of bcm43xx-softmac to mac80211 has this issue.

I think that a great many other drivers will have this issue too.
