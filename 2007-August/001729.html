Sorry for taking this long to respond.

I have now tested this patch and it keeps the connection alive, but it forces 
link rate to 1Mbit with occational 5.5Mbit spikes even when next to AP. 
iwconfig reports link quality ca 30/100 and signal -30dBm when next to AP. 
70/100 and signal -60 when 10 meters away.

Not sure if desired tx power should have changed, but it remains at 6.75dBm.

I will try the patch you provided for bcm43xx-mac80211 on the bcm4301 driver 
and see how it fares.
