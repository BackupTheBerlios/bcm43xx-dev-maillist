I have no idea what he is/was talking about. Until late yesterday, the best performance was with the 
unaltered bcm43xx, or the port of that driver to mac80211. Today, the changes now propagating 
through the system make bcm43xx-mac80211 into the preferred driver. You should ask Fedora how soon 
those will make it into their development kernels (called Rawhide?).

If you want to use this new code now, you will need to use git to get the contents of Linville's 
wireless-dev tree and get the patches from the mailing list, or I can post them on my FTP site. If 
you can wait a day or so, Linville should incorporate those patches. In either case, the new version 
auto-scales the rate to 54M for most cards. Even the BCM4318, which has been the most trouble, gets 
up to 19 Mbs receiving, and 12 transmitting. The BCM4311 gets 20 Mbs in both directions.
