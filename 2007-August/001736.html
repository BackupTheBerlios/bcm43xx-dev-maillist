I'm sure you can help git development if you post your observations to
the git list.

&gt;<i> With quilt and my scripts I can easily push them upstream to linville,

stg export -np
stg mail --all

&gt;<i> Going back to old patches works perfect with quilt.
</I>
I see.  One thing I didn't like in quilt is that I have to decide what
I'm going to do before actually changing the sources.  And it's
impossible to revert changes made before the patch is created.

But I understand it's a question of habits, and everybody has different
preferences when it comes to the tools.

&gt;<i> And I am not going to maintain out of tree stuff anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>
That's why I suggested the lightweight tree:

Makefile
drivers/
  ssb/
    ssb sources
  net/
    wireless/
      bcm43xx_mac80211/
        bcm43xx_mac80211 sources

The top-level Makefile finds the kernel sources and compiles against
them.  It can also have maintenance targets, such as &quot;indent&quot;.

&gt;<i> Yes, I looked at stgit before writing my own set of scripts on top
</I>&gt;<i> of quilt. And I found out that it doesn't quite fit my needs.
</I>
OK, it's getting off-topic, but if you need help with stgit, please feel
free to ask.
