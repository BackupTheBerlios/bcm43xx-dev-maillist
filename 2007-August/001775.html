Well, there are good reasons for not removing this.
The resons include that this message is only shown for the debug build.
So if you want it to shut up, don't compile a debug build.
It's the task of a debug build to show problems. If you don't care about
problems, disable it.
This message is not fatal in the sense that is prevents the device from
working, but it is very well fatal in the sense that the LO is not
adjusted properly. Which means you are probably radiating frequencies
that you are not licensed to.

Yeah, I'd like to get rid of this message, too. But by fixing the
bug and not by hiding it.

So any suggestions on how to fix this?
The problem is that I'm not sure why we calibrate the LO by these strange
tables. Maybe we can fix this by dropping the tables and simply
calibrate it for every possible attenuation.
These tables have some relation to the hardware power control.
So maybe we don't need to adjust the LO from the txpower routines
at all, when using hwpctl? (Only on demand of the power vector).
