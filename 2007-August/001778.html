I think you could try to write a detailed explanation of the problem, in
particular, what those tables do, where the numbers come from, what
hardware is affected, what the driver does now, what it should do, and
how to find out the right solution from reverse engineering data.

After all, there are working drivers for the chipset, and they can be
reverse engineered.  It cannot be a problem with no solution.

Chances are that you will have some ideas before you finish writing the
message.  It happened to me many times.  But even if it doesn't happen,
you will make it easy for others to suggest solutions.  And you will
give the reverse engineering team some ideas what to look for.
