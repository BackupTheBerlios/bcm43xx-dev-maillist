Hm, yes there might be a bug.
But I'm not convinced the attached patch was right.
I'm not sure what happens in the TX status reports for packets that don't
get acked. But I think it would just return not-acked and a retry count of 1.
So what we really want here is to check if the retry count is equal to maximum.
Well, what is maximum. See the other fixme in that code there where we check
the RTS retry count. The retry count is adjustable and currently we don't keep
track of it. And there's even a difference between short and long packets.
Look for short vs long retry limit.
Not that easy to fix, actually.
Anyway, I think we should configure the retry limits through cfg80211.
