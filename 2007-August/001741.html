<PRE>&gt;<i> I see.  One thing I didn't like in quilt is that I have to
</I>&gt;<i> decide what I'm going to do before actually changing the
</I>&gt;<i> sources.
</I>
All I have to decide beforehand is the name of patch. In stgit 
this is the same. However, stg is worse, because there I even 
have to enter a description of what I'm about to do beforehand. 
*)

Sometimes, I just make patches in quilt, then I do &quot;quilt 
refresh&quot;, &quot;quilt pop -a&quot;, &quot;cd patches&quot; and modify the patches 
and series file manually, e.g. by moving one patch from one file 
into the other. The &quot;cd ..&quot;, &quot;quilt push -a&quot; and off I am. That 
the &quot;database&quot; of quilt is in a known format and I can hack on 
it with an editor is a plus for me :-)

That said: once I'm finished with quilt-things, I'm using stg 
import to import this into git and use git to send it off to the 
mailing list. I'm not working with stg on the first place, 
because quilt is noticably faster than stg.



*) in stgit I can do &quot;stg refresh -e&quot; to edit the description 
afterwards
