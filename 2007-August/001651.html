No, the desired power, is the power value we get from mac80211.
So it hardly changes.
The value from the SHM is the estimated current output power.
And it correctly estimates it for me on the 4306.
However it does not seem to work on the 4318. It always returns
20db there, which is bogus. I _think_ that on the 4318 the value
is generated by one of the new lookup tables. So I think there's
a bug in the lookup tables that are written for hwpctl devices.
