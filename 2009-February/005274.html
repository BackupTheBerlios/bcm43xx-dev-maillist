This has nothing to do with overheating, so let's reduce FUD a bit. ;)

The attenuation is not linear. There's a certain threshold where it inverts.
Let's explain it in simple numbers. Let's say the attenuation A is from 0-9.
The actual power output O would looke something like this:

A=   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
O=   0  1  2  3  4  4  3  2  1  0

This is true for broadcom cards and some atheros cards.
So as we decrease attennuation, there's a point where output power is inverted.
In this simple example we must not go below an A value of 5.

The actual threshold is different for each device and you're pretty much likely
hitting it. The control algorithm is unaware of this threshold and it will scale
the attenuation down which results in lower power which will result in scaling down...


So John, back to your problem. I think you're pretty much lost with it. Like thousands
of other people (including me) are lost with crappy broadcom devices.
I suggest you go and buy something sane instead.

I cannot help you anymore with this.
