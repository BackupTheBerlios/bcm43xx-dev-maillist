Yes it is. You need two slots per data packet.

&gt;<i> If this is correct, the condition observed by Larry could be due to  
</I>&gt;<i> some packets being lost during their travel in the fifo run by the dma  
</I>&gt;<i> system?
</I>
Well I'm not completely sure what's going on exactly. I only know that we
get bad cookies that the driver doesn't expect.

&gt;<i> It seems that the firmware is reporting status for not all   
</I>&gt;<i> packets that have been sent through the dma,
</I>
Whoopsy, it is _required_ to report status for every single packet.
That's a basic assumption that must not be violated, as it's used for
freeing the DMA memory in the driver.

However, it should not corrupt anything. It will just grind
the DMA to a halt 64 packets after a status report was missed.
I never tried this, however.
