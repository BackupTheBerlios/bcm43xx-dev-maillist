&gt;<i> I want to thank you guys once again for your advice, last week on my BCM4306 problem. I've tried 20dBm, 15, 12, and 10dBm, with varying degrees of success. Which, is just a fancy way of saying, no real success.

Getting open-source firmware won't make a difference as firmware is not your
problem. The main advantage is that the new firmware will have a GPL license and
can be included with the distros. No one is expecting it to be better than  the
proprietary firmware.

&gt;<i> If it doesn't, and frankly, I'm not hopefull, is there any way of going back to bcm43xx. It'd be a shame to abandon a card which worked perfectly well, before, even if it's not as open as we'd like. A lot of us are stuck with this device in otherwise perfectly good laptops.
</I>
The short answer is &quot;No&quot;. With bcm43xx, the MAC layer was controlled by
something called SoftMAC. It was buggy and limited, which is why it was replaced
by mac80211. It would require a great deal of work to get SoftMAC to work with
modern kernels. You could modify bcm43xx to work with mac80211, but then you
would have the equivalent of b43 as that is essentially how b43 and b43legacy
were produced.

What I would suggest is that you build a 2.6.23 kernel and test bcm43xx that way
to see if something changed in your hardware, or if it really is b43 that fails
with your device.

&gt;<i> One more question and i hope you don't mind, it's off topic but it's related to my quest. I hadven't done any C programming in 10 years but when I used to do a lot of it, if I patche a source file and ran 'make', it figured out what needed to be done and just recompiled and liknked the changed bits. Over the last week, every time I changed phy_g.c, make calmly repied, 'nothing to be done.'  What am I forgetting?
</I>
That would indicate that your Makefile doesn't have a dependency on phy_g.c.
