Well, indeed. ;)

You should throw your broken hw away, if it causes harmful interference.
It's as simple as that. Problem solved. :)

Hardware simply often _is_ crap and causes harmful interference.
One example being an S3 video card which caused a parport extender card
to output extremely crappy signals. I simply bought a new video adapter
and all interference problems disappeared.
Often such interference doesn't matter. I bet the parport adapter still
worked with most common parport devices. But I had a milling machine connected
to it which moved a tiny bit on each interference storm. So I could move the joints
with glxgears. ;)

So I can certainly imagine that interference can break a wireless adapter
completely. In fact, I do own a motherboard where 90% of broadcom wireless NICs
fail to work on. It clearly is caused by interference, because they work fine
if I put a shielding extender between the board and the NIC.
