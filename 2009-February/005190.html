In previous crashes, there has always been a number of queued
tx_status responses. Perhaps the missing cookies were there. This time
I stopped the microcode CPU and never restarted it, but now that it
looks as if the dump is OK, I will start it again right after the dump.

So far, I have only seen these crashes when I stress the device using
two transmit streams - one with small packets (a flood ping) and one
with large packets (the tcpperf test). Even then, it has taken as long
as 7 hours to cause the crash. On other occasions, it takes just
minutes. The bug must have only a narrow window to trigger. In
addition, these tests were the first ones I tried.

FWIW, the proprietary firmware ran my test for 12 hours without failing.

Do you suggest any additional checks in the tx_status routine? Could I
compare the received cookie with some part of SHM?

Larry
