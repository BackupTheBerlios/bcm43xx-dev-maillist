I think you're looking at the wrong place.
The check for the tx status queue must be a _lot_ earlier. It must be
even before we route the frame from the DMA engine to the TXE.
I bet it's one of the very first conditions that start the TX operation.

The basic idea is that we must check all buffers, including the tx status report
buffer, before we start the TX operation. Because if we started it and we notice
right in the middle of the operation that we lack bufferspace somewhere, we're
screwed.

That's my theory. I cannot back it up with facts, but it sounds sane to me.


But, why do we talk about this, actually? Do we actually know what went wrong, yet?
Larry, did you dump a cookie of a frame that would trigger the crash? What does the
ring memory allocation look like at the time the crash would trigger? Are there holes
in the ring memory? What does the crashing cookie point to? The end of the ring (aprox)
or somewhere completely different.
printk printk printk printk... :)
