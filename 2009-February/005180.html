</I>Finally I got my equipment, a rev 3 4306 Broadcom cardbus adapter, to  
crash too. What is strange is that during the weekend I did several  
tests and everything was fine.

Today, instead, I brought both laptop and cardbus adapter into the lab  
and each time I begin to download even very small files, it crashes.  
This happens with both openfwwf and original Broadcom firmware. I  
tested another cardbus adapter (though I believe they are the same,  
both Belkin) and it crashes too. Switching back to internal mini-pci,  
instead, I have no problems.

Unfortunately I do not observe any message from console, I set /proc/ 
sys/kernel/printk to log everything but the system simply hangs and I  
have to switch it off.

The only difference between the lab and my home networks is that here  
(lab) we have several SSIDs broadcasted, I can clearly observe tens of  
APs on the same channel and a lot of background traffic.

Note that the PC is rock solid, it never crashes in other conditions.  
The same situation appears with two cardbus adapters so I can't  
believe they are both broken and independently of the cardbus slot I  
plug the network adapter into.

Has anyone knowledge about incompatibility between b43/bcm adapters  
and this kind of CardBus bridge (as reported by lspci)

CardBus bridge: ENE Technology Inc CB-720/2/4 Cardbus Controller (rev  
01)

I always believed it was 32-bit (isn't it?) and I used it without  
problems for a long time with an Atheros controller so I believe it is  
not broken.

Cheers
