For my understanding of what's going on with Larry's adapter, may I  
kindly ask you if the following picture is correct?

I simply put a printk just at the top of op32_poke_tx and another in  
handle_irq_transmit_status. I injected as mush traffic as I can by  
sending UDP style frames through a raw socket to the wireless  
interface, I send ten thousands packets so to enter a &quot;regime&quot;  
condition: after the first  hundreds packets are sent, I see from  
dmesg a op32_poke_tx line followed by a handle_irq_transmit_status  
line, these two couple of lines repeated thousands times. More  
interesting is what happens at the end when I stop sending packets on  
the raw socket: the kernel stops filling the queue, and in dmesg we  
can see only handle_irq_transmit_status lines corresponding to frames  
still in the tx fifo. The firmware is removing these last packets and  
for each of them it will send a IRQ after sending. It always turn out  
that the queue had 64 packets inside, I always see 64 consecutive  
lines about handle_irq_transmit_stats. Is this number (64) due to the  
definition

#define B43_TXRING_SLOTS                128

in dma.h? For what I understand a slot is used for tx header, the  
other for the actual packet, isn'it? So we have half of 128 slots for  
64 packets.

If this is correct, the condition observed by Larry could be due to  
some packets being lost during their travel in the fifo run by the dma  
system? It seems that the firmware is reporting status for not all  
packets that have been sent through the dma, but we know that the  
firmware always reports status _unless_ the mac ctl register is set to  
skip status reporting. Could we investigate on this or I'm completely  
wrong?

Cheers,
-Francesco
