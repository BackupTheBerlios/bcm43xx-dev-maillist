<PRE>work around it by setting an exception for subsys venID:0x100F and subsys
prodID:0x1043 to always treat BFL_BTCMOD as 1 if BFL_BTCOEXIST is set to 1.
(Possibly this is acceptable for all subsys IDs, not just the Asus-specific
one I wrote here, as I have yet to see a non-Asus BCM43xx that has
BFL_BTCOEXIST set, but not BFL_BTCMOD.) However, if it's a bug in our
Bluetooth coexistence code, then we shouldn't just apply the workaround, but
find and fix the actual bug that causes the bug if the workaround isn't
applied.

Bisection complete!&lt;br&gt;After testing numerous settings for BoardFlags, I fo=
und that the only ones to have a benefical effect on the card is 0x4049/0x4=
249 and 0x0048/0x0248, which differs from the original 0x0049 only in the B=
FL_BTCMOD bit, which is 0 by default, but 1 in this configuration. Not only=
 that, setting BoardFlags to 0x4049 and leaving everything else as is in th=
e original Asus SPROM fixes BOTH the &quot;No TX&quot; and the &quot;ping t=
ime cycle&quot; bugs! Even monitoring/packetspamming while operating works =
perfectly. The setting 0x4249 produces the same (perfectly-working) result,=
 only with Afterburner marked as supported. (Not sure if it actually gets e=
nabled, though.) Setting BFL_FEM to 1 (0x4849 or 0x4A49) introduces the &amp;qu=
ot;ping cycle&quot; bug, most likely because the card doesn&#39;t actually =
support the Front-End Module. BFL_HGPA=3D1 (0x6049/0x6249) causes ping pack=
et loss /duplicate count to increase somewhat, likely because the card does=
n&#39;t have a high-gain PA. 0x0048 and 0x0248 also work fine, although thi=
s setting disables Bluetooth coexistence (BFL_BTCOEXIST). So, it looks like=
 BoardFlags was intended to be 0x4249, but Asus incorrectly sets it to 0x00=
49, which completely breaks transmission in b43.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For reference, here is BFL_BTCMOD&#39;s description from bcm-specs:&lt;br&gt;=
&quot;0x4000: BFL_BTCMOD: BFL_BTCOEXIST is given in alternate GPIOs&quot;.&lt;=
br&gt;BFL_BTCOEXIST is defined as:&lt;br&gt;&quot;0x0001: BFL_BTCOEXIST: Board imple=
ments Bluetooth coexistance[sic]&quot;. I don&#39;t know if &quot;coexistan=
ce&quot; is a misspelling or if it&#39;s the correct spelling in British, b=
ut if it&#39;s unintended, then it should be fixed. (Just nit-picking, sorr=
y.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;From this, the problem appears to be a Bluetooth coexistence bug. We ca=
n work around it by setting an exception for subsys venID:0x100F and subsys=
 prodID:0x1043 to always treat BFL_BTCMOD as 1 if BFL_BTCOEXIST is set to 1=
. (Possibly this is acceptable for all subsys IDs, not just the Asus-specif=
ic one I wrote here, as I have yet to see a non-Asus BCM43xx that has BFL_B=
TCOEXIST set, but not BFL_BTCMOD.) However, if it&#39;s a bug in our Blueto=
oth coexistence code, then we shouldn&#39;t just apply the workaround, but =
find and fix the actual bug that causes the bug if the workaround isn&#39;t=
 applied.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;
