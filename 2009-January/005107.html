Thanks a lot. That's very nice. I'm interested in implementing the stuff
and I already started to implement the existing specs stuff.
I'm interested to get the Asus WL500Gv2 working, which has an LP-PHY.

Thanks again for your hard work on the specs.
It seems there are a few things I don't quite understand, yet. Is it best
to use private mail to you to ask some questions, or are you planning to join
the #bcm-specs IRC channel, so I can ask questions there. I prefer the IRC
channel, but I fully accept, if you don't like that and prefer mail.
The reason I prefer IRC is that it usually has less communication delays and
allows &quot;quick questions&quot;.

Thanks.
