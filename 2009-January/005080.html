</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - 4306, 4311, 4318, 4320
</I>
I don't think it has enough testing, yet.

&gt;<i> I was considering the suggestions you all gave me a few days ago and  
</I>&gt;<i> other questions related to the possible integration of this firmware  
</I>&gt;<i> into the kernel, and I came to these conclusions/questions (please  
</I>&gt;<i> forgive me for this long message :-) )
</I>
I don't think we want to have the firmware in the kernel.
Instead distributions should simply ship the firmware in a package.
That's not our business.

&gt;<i> - change the name of the initvals for the opensource firmware: this  
</I>
Why?

&gt;<i> seems a little bit complicated as now the decision about the initval- 
</I>&gt;<i> files' names and the detection of the firmware type are respectively  
</I>&gt;<i> based on the phy type and on the firmware date. This means that  
</I>&gt;<i> initval-files' names can be determine as soon as the hardware type has  
</I>&gt;<i> been probed, while the firmware needs to be started before the kernel  
</I>&gt;<i> can determine if it is opensource or not: at this time, however, the  
</I>&gt;<i> initvals have already been uploaded. What can we do?
</I>
Nothing. Why do we need to have different names?

&gt;<i> - detection of the opensource firmware capabilities: are you really  
</I>&gt;<i> sure we cannot use a shm location that the bcm proprietary firmware  
</I>&gt;<i> uses for some other purpose?
</I>
Yes, well. You're not intermixing an earlier discussion into this, where
you didn't indicate opensource capabilities to the kernel.
If you indicate OS capabilities, you can use whatever offset you want, of course.

&gt;<i> - what to do with rts procedure: we can implement this feature easily  
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm not sure about the value it can add to people (the majority of  
</I>&gt;<i> users?) that use the bcm board in station mode. This is different for  
</I>&gt;<i> those who run a bcm card in AP mode, but we can clearly discourage  
</I>&gt;<i> them to run this firmware in AP mode if  not sure about rts usage by  
</I>&gt;<i> stations. However, we put this task in the todo list.
</I>
RTS/CTS is not specific to AP mode. It's used on any station in the BSS.
See IEEE 802.11 specs.

&gt;<i> - tx header layout: the opensource firmware is now using the old  
</I>&gt;<i> memory layout in the tx header (&lt;351). Do you think switching to 410  
</I>&gt;<i> format is mandatory now or we can concentrate on the other tasks?
</I>
Yes, the old format is deprecated and will be removed soon.

&gt;<i> - I would like to start considering N-phy on the firmware side. I have  
</I>&gt;<i> a late 2008 MacBook Pro and I'm not sure if beginning this work on  
</I>&gt;<i> this platform is a waste of time or not as Apple could have asked  
</I>&gt;<i> Broadcom a customized chipset. Should I start or is it better if I buy  
</I>&gt;<i> a N-phy pci board for my x86 box?
</I>
A little bit of b43-asm work is still needed for this core.
There are a few FIXMEs in the code. Not sure, maybe there's more to do.
I didn't try that, yet.
Before you start, you'll have to verify whether the assembler works correctly.
Same for the disassembler.

Greetings, Michael.
