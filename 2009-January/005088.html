</I>Sorry sorry sorry and sorry again... it was a Larry question, not  
John's... pardon me

However, it's not a problem maintaining these names.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - detection of the opensource firmware capabilities: are you really
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sure we cannot use a shm location that the bcm proprietary firmware
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> uses for some other purpose?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, well. You're not intermixing an earlier discussion into this,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you didn't indicate opensource capabilities to the kernel.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you indicate OS capabilities, you can use whatever offset you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> want, of course.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Excellent. We will modify the firmware accordingly and encode the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks. Would be nice if you could also do the corresponding driver  
</I>&gt;<i> patch.
</I>Ok, it should be simple.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - tx header layout: the opensource firmware is now using the old
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> memory layout in the tx header (&lt;351). Do you think switching to  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 410
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> format is mandatory now or we can concentrate on the other tasks?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, the old format is deprecated and will be removed soon.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok, first task in the todo list!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, doesn't need to the the first one. Just note that support for  
</I>&gt;<i> this is
</I>&gt;<i> scheduled to be removed in summer 2008. So if any problems show up  
</I>&gt;<i> (broadcom
</I>&gt;<i> releases yet another API, for example), I will immediately remove it.
</I>Well, it's the first because it's the easiest :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Ok, thanks for the hint. I will check,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few things we're not yet sure about.
</I>&gt;<i> For example the operand for the GPR number got an additional bit.
</I>&gt;<i> But we're not sure if the real number of GPRs also was doubled in  
</I>&gt;<i> the hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few FIXMEs in the code for this...
</I>&gt;<i> I think this simply has to be tested by trial and error.
</I>Thanks, I will surely check this.

Cheers,
-FG
