</I>&gt;<i> - 4306, 4311, 4318, 4320
</I>
As a point of clarification, I think this is restricted to the 4311/1
as the 4311/2 uses ucode13, not ucode5. If you need a tester for an
open-source version of the 13 firmware, I'm available.

&gt;<i> I was considering the suggestions you all gave me a few days ago and
</I>&gt;<i> other questions related to the possible integration of this firmware

</I>&gt;<i> forgive me for this long message :-) )
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> initval-files' names and the detection of the firmware type are

</I>&gt;<i> that initval-files' names can be determine as soon as the hardware type

</I>&gt;<i> kernel can determine if it is opensource or not: at this time, however,
</I>&gt;<i> the initvals have already been uploaded. What can we do?
</I>
The driver can certainly be coded to look for the open-source firmware
names before trying to load vendor firmware. That way there will not
be any confusion.

&gt;<i> - detection of the opensource firmware capabilities: are you really sure
</I>&gt;<i> we cannot use a shm location that the bcm proprietary firmware uses for
</I>&gt;<i> some other purpose? Once, in fact, the kernel has determined that the
</I>&gt;<i> firmware is opensource it can also use a given location in a different
</I>&gt;<i> manner than it would do for a proprietary firmware. However this is not
</I>&gt;<i> a problem at all :-) as we can use one location in the &quot;high&quot; shm-memory
</I>&gt;<i> area, let's say &gt; 0xb00, just choose one.
</I>
I think it best to choose an unused location.
