I use Konversation. It's pretty convenient and has a lot of features.
But there are other good clients, too. If you're commandline addict, BitchX is pretty good.
XChat also isn't that bad, but I had a reason to switch away from it. I don't quite remember. :)

If you type &quot;irc&quot; into freshmeat, you probably find a lot more that I forgot about.
