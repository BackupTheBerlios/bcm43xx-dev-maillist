</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it has enough testing, yet.
</I>Sure, it seems to be stable on _our_ boards but I can't tell if it  
shows the same behavior on other hardware revisions.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was considering the suggestions you all gave me a few days ago and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into the kernel, and I came to these conclusions/questions (please
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forgive me for this long message :-) )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we want to have the firmware in the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead distributions should simply ship the firmware in a package.
</I>&gt;<i> That's not our business.
</I>
I agree with you, distributions could easily package the firmware and  
distribute it to users when it will be stable, I was just wondering  
about.

&gt;&gt;<i> - change the name of the initvals for the opensource firmware: this
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [cut]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initvals have already been uploaded. What can we do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing. Why do we need to have different names?
</I>Well, I was only considering a question raised by John, we can surely  
maintain these names.

&gt;&gt;<i> - detection of the opensource firmware capabilities: are you really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure we cannot use a shm location that the bcm proprietary firmware
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uses for some other purpose?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, well. You're not intermixing an earlier discussion into this,  
</I>&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;<i> you didn't indicate opensource capabilities to the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> If you indicate OS capabilities, you can use whatever offset you  
</I>&gt;<i> want, of course.
</I>Excellent. We will modify the firmware accordingly and encode the  
options.

&gt;&gt;<i> - what to do with rts procedure: we can implement this feature easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I'm not sure about the value it can add to people (the majority  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users?) that use the bcm board in station mode. This is different for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those who run a bcm card in AP mode, but we can clearly discourage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them to run this firmware in AP mode if  not sure about rts usage by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stations. However, we put this task in the todo list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> RTS/CTS is not specific to AP mode. It's used on any station in the  
</I>&gt;<i> BSS.
</I>&gt;<i> See IEEE 802.11 specs.
</I>Yes, in fact we put this task in the todo list.

&gt;&gt;<i> - tx header layout: the opensource firmware is now using the old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory layout in the tx header (&lt;351). Do you think switching to 410
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format is mandatory now or we can concentrate on the other tasks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the old format is deprecated and will be removed soon.
</I>Ok, first task in the todo list!

&gt;&gt;<i> - I would like to start considering N-phy on the firmware side. I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a late 2008 MacBook Pro and I'm not sure if beginning this work on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this platform is a waste of time or not as Apple could have asked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Broadcom a customized chipset. Should I start or is it better if I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a N-phy pci board for my x86 box?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A little bit of b43-asm work is still needed for this core.
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few FIXMEs in the code. Not sure, maybe there's more to  
</I>&gt;<i> do.
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't try that, yet.
</I>&gt;<i> Before you start, you'll have to verify whether the assembler works  
</I>&gt;<i> correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> Same for the disassembler.
</I>Ok, thanks for the hint. I will check,

Cheers,
-FG
