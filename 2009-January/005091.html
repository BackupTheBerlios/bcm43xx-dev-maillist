</I>Well, I just tested a 500Mbytes bulk transfer and I got a mean  
throughput of about 5.5Mbit/s, it was a simple infinite wget loop so  
we can have some slowness due to TCP. However no errors were logged to  
syslog and the AP is still there, it didn't complain about anything.

I built kamikaze yesterday image (r14144), kernel 2.6.25.17, I used  
the AP as a station joined to another AP without encryption.

By the way, we did thousands of tests with x86 and we came to the  
conclusion that there is no performance (throughput) difference if  
compared to the standard proprietary firmware.

Cheers,
