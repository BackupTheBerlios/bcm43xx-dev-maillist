</I>
The only patch I had applied to 2.6.29-rc2-wl was to have b43 look for
opensource firmware before the proprietary version. The complete set
of files from the openfwwf-5.1.tar.gz were applied and the firmware
built from them. I am modprobing with qos=0 and nohwcrypto=1. I have a
PCCARD format. It is labeled as a Linksys WPC54G, ver. 3.

&gt;<i> The strange thing is that the way b43 is interfaced to the firmware,
</I>&gt;<i> when hw encryption is not activated, does not change switching from 351
</I>&gt;<i> to 410 version apart for the txheader layout: however we modified that
</I>&gt;<i> layout according to definitions in xmit.h. Is this correct? If this hold
</I>&gt;<i> I really can not understand why r5.1 had problems and r5.0 not in your
</I>&gt;<i> setup. I would have supposed that given r5.1 has problems, the same can
</I>&gt;<i> arise also on r5.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tests description: we did the following couple of tests
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - downloaded 1GB through TCP while sending 1.6GB of UDP like traffic
</I>&gt;<i> through a raw socket, 10 ping/s
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - sent 10GBYTE by injecting packets composed in userspace through a
</I>&gt;<i> ioctl we attached to mac80211 stack: packets are sent one after another
</I>&gt;<i> without ACKs, separated by just a SIFS and encoded at 54Mb/s (this is a
</I>&gt;<i> very small firmware hack that reprograms next transmission opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> when you want, in this case just after the SIFS and only for frames sent
</I>&gt;<i> to one not existing MAC addresses, so that no ack is sent by no one).
</I>&gt;<i> Actual packets transmission verified by sniffing the channel by using
</I>&gt;<i> another Broadcom card
</I>
Your tests are a lot more rigorous than mine.

I'll repeat my tests.
