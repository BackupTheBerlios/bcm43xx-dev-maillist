Did you check if it does actually work correctly? Especially beaconing.
There were lots of changes to b43's beaconing, which were not ported to legacy.

b43 works in AP mode.
However, keep in mind that challenged cards, that don't work well in STA mode, don't
work better in AP mode either. So if your card works well in STA mode with good
throughput, you won't experience any problems in AP mode.

I am running a 4318 in AP mode. This works, but I don't recommend it due to the
high-tx-rate problems of the 4318.
Older 4306 devices should work fine, however.

But if I were to _buy_ a new card for AP mode, I'd go with atheros or something like that...
