No the interrupt indicates a PHY TX error.
This name is from the broadcom headers, so we can trust that it's correct.

As I said, I never saw the error with the proprietary firmware in monitor mode.
If you know a way how to trigger them, please tell me.

Well, the question is what can we learn from this test? ;)
What we really need is a way to find out which part of the PHY triggers
this error. We have a dozen of methods to trigger the error. But we _still_
do not know the lowlevel PHY conditions that result in an error.

Probably somebody with lots of time should randomly go through the code
and set various PHY thresholds to big/small values. Maybe that'll point us into
some direction. The problem is that the code basically is undocumented and we
only write blob values to the registers. So from reading the code you won't even
know where these values are written. But the specs give some useful hints. ;)
