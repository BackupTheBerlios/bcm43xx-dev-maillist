<PRE>Before submitting this to bugzilla.redhat.com, I hope you won't
mind my asking your advice here. I just returned from a round trip
to Florida, and thanks to your hard work I was able to use WiFi
everywhere I went, and I can't thank you enough.

However, upon my return I decided to catch up on all the updates
and now my FC10 installation is up to date. However, WiFi doesn't
work any more, or to be exact, dhcp doesn't. I have a d-link router
that does both wired and wireless, and my laptop can connect either
way. dhclient eth0 works fine, dhclient wlan0 doesn't. However, I
can manually assign an IP address to wlan0, edit the routing tables
and /etc/resolv.conf, and WiFi works just fine.

The router is configured to use a specific IP address for eth0 and
a different one for wlan0, using their MAC addresses as a index.

I asked about this on the Fedora networking forum and only got a reply
from someone else having a similar problem. So my questions are:

Is this a problem with dhclient, wpa_supplicant, or b43 (or something
else)? Can you suggest a way to troubleshoot this? I can see nothing at
all unusual in any logs and I won't clog up your inbox with dumps unless
you ask for them. Here's all I ever get from dhclient

# dhclient -v -d wlan0

etc...

The current kernel: 2.6.27.19-170.2.35.fc10.x86_64

There are several other WiFi devices on this network getting good
responses from dhcp, so I don't think it is the router, and there are
no other APs for miles. Any insights would be much appreciated, and
thanks for your time.
