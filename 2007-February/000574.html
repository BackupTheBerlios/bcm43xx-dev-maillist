Thanks for the offer, but my only machine with a PCI slot is Windows only. If I were to put Linux on
it, my wife would have my head. She isn't very happy with Vista, but she does a lot of stuff that
won't run on Linux, even under Wine. Perhaps with vmware, but I'm not going there now.

Does anyone in the US have a laptop that they could loan me? It doesn't have to be much. It would
not be running X, thus the memory requirements would be low. In fact, the display need not work as I
would ssh into it as I have been doing. Similarly, no hard-wired network card is needed. I have a
hard drive that I would use. Of course, it needs a working PCMCIA slot.

Thanks,

Larry
