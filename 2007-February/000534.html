From what I've seen in the ucode that question isn't really too hard to
answer: as long as it's not in the shared memory or ucode register space
the ucode can't really have an influence.

Best bet would be to make it conditional right now and have someone test
for these cases with older hw.

&gt;<i> If the revision

</I>
Hmm. Same I guess, use the new check for new hw and the old check for
old hw, i.e. assume it's the former and not a bug fix (until tested
otherwise.)

I think our best bet is to treat the older hw the same as the older
driver does.

A bigger problem, IMO, is that we'd have to support all the older
microcode things which is a bit tricky since things in shm have moved a
lot... Maybe we should find a third maintainer who has access to a
couple of old cards :)
