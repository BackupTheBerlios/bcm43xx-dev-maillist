</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What kernel, SMP/UP, PREEMPTION option, architecture and patch level of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bcm43xx, please?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I won't see that machine until Monday, but I'm quite sure that the kernel was
</I>&gt;<i> from the current master branch of the mb repository (I have no idea how current
</I>&gt;<i> the bcm43xx softmac driver is there, but the kernel version was 2.6.20).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a UP kernel with no preemption.  NetworkManager is not used.  It's a Fedora
</I>&gt;<i> Core 6 install, x86 architecture (Pentium M) with all updates and custom kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The card is a MiniPCI 4306.  I have two revisions, and it was the newer of them
</I>&gt;<i> (the older one was mentioned to be in a PowerPC).  I described the cards
</I>&gt;<i> recently.  Sorry, I'm away from my list archives, but I hope you will find the
</I>&gt;<i> description.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was checking one of the registers that Michael mentioned as a problem.  It was
</I>&gt;<i> 0 or a small value on bcm43xx_d80211 and 56 in bcm43xx.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed that unloading bcm43xx_d80211 was fine, but bcm43xx would report
</I>&gt;<i> several (10 maybe) assertion failures in a row if unloaded with the interface
</I>&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I found the assertion and added a printk that indicated that the unexpected
</I>&gt;<i> state was always SHUTTINGDOWN.  I looked at the code for turning off the
</I>&gt;<i> interrupts, and noticed that it's done several times in a loop after switching
</I>&gt;<i> the core.  At this point I realized that the problem was over my head (given my
</I>&gt;<i> time constrains), so I wrote the previous e-mail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since I now realize that it's not the expected behavior, I'll try to collect
</I>&gt;<i> more information about the problem.

The bcm43xx-softmac version in the mb tree is a little behind wireless-2.6. The attached patch will
bring it up to date with the wireless-2.6 tree with my local modifications.
