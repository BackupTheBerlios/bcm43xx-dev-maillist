Hmm, you're right, I was wrong about them not doing a rev4 v4 firmware.

Yup, looks like. The question is what we do about them. Do we just
remove support for them once bcm43xx gets deleted in favour of the
d80211 version?

&gt;<i> In a related matter, my BCM4306's have only 30-bit DMA, and the fixes for DMA with more than 1 GB

</I>&gt;<i> and submit such a patch for d80211.

Ah, great. I don't actually have that much memory in my laptop, and no
PCI machine to put my PCI bcm card in...
