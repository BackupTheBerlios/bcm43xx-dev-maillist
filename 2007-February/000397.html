<PRE>Hello!

This patch to bcm43xx_d80211 makes my bcm4312 associate with 802.11g
access points immediately:

As I wrote before, my card has a problem with 802.11g APs under
bcm43xx_d80211 driver.  It would associate once given all parameters
(channel, ap, essid), and it would even show a non-zero link quality,
but no data packets would go through for at least several minutes.

Note that even with this patch, the driver is still telling the d80211
stack that is supports 802.11g and has an 802.11g PHY.  It just doesn't
provide any OFDM rates.

iperf over TCP shows rates around 4 Mbps, which is pretty decent,
although less than 6 Mbps measured with the softmac driver in the same
setup.

I tried to enable rates 6, 9 and 12.  In this case, it takes a few
seconds (but not minutes) before ping starts working.  The speed was
much lower, about 800 kbps.  When trying to measure it again, the driver
started printing this:

The system became unresponsive and I had to reboot it.  I've never seen
this problem if all OFDM rates are disabled.
