<PRE>Quoting Larry Finger &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">larry.finger at lwfinger.net</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> &gt; I wish I could implement the first solution, but since the interrupts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are disabled in a loop involving core switches, things are not trivial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What kernel, SMP/UP, PREEMPTION option, architecture and patch level of
</I>&gt;<i> bcm43xx, please?
</I>
I won't see that machine until Monday, but I'm quite sure that the kernel was
from the current master branch of the mb repository (I have no idea how current
the bcm43xx softmac driver is there, but the kernel version was 2.6.20).

It's a UP kernel with no preemption.  NetworkManager is not used.  It's a Fedora
Core 6 install, x86 architecture (Pentium M) with all updates and custom kernel.

The card is a MiniPCI 4306.  I have two revisions, and it was the newer of them
(the older one was mentioned to be in a PowerPC).  I described the cards
recently.  Sorry, I'm away from my list archives, but I hope you will find the
description.

I was checking one of the registers that Michael mentioned as a problem.  It was
0 or a small value on bcm43xx_d80211 and 56 in bcm43xx.

I noticed that unloading bcm43xx_d80211 was fine, but bcm43xx would report
several (10 maybe) assertion failures in a row if unloaded with the interface
up.

I found the assertion and added a printk that indicated that the unexpected
state was always SHUTTINGDOWN.  I looked at the code for turning off the
interrupts, and noticed that it's done several times in a loop after switching
the core.  At this point I realized that the problem was over my head (given my
time constrains), so I wrote the previous e-mail.

Since I now realize that it's not the expected behavior, I'll try to collect
more information about the problem.
