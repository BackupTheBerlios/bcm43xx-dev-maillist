It's _really_ a pain to support both v3 and v4 fw in one driver.
I tried it, but it's really really hard to do. The API to the FW
is different in so many ways.
We would have to completely abstract the SharedMemory accesses.
That would mean a lot of additional code and functions (or we could
clutter the code with if{}else{} all over, which is even worse (IMO).

So, I would say we should have a seperate driver, probably also based
on d80211 for very old cards. But I don't really want to maintain
such a beast either. (I also don't have the required old HW).
