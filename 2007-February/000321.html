There are lots of &quot;maybe&quot;s in your statement.
How about reading the code? It will answer all your questions.

And yes, I didn't count the MMIO accesses, but it is a _lot_.
If you want to compare them, go for it. Nobody else will, as it's
too much work. This effort is better put into actually reading,
understanding and fixing the code.
