bcm43xx firmware can definitely handle QoS.

I would expect you to find that it is not, but just run a monitor
interface in addition.

&gt;<i> I agree.  The frames are either not received physically or thrown out.

Could you start capturing earlier to confirm this?

Didn't you say that you're using mb's tree? You have a 4311 IIRC so I
wouldn't be surprised if there are problems with receive sensitivity
that go away after, say, two minutes (recalibration interval).
