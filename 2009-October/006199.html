<PRE>I'm not sure that this is a b43 thing, but hopefully, even if it isn't,
someone here will be able to point me in the right direction.

My 4318 (details below) has been working fine for quite some time with
b43.  As recently as 2.6.31, it was still working:

The early 2.6.32 rc kernels were giving oopses, apparently because of
this:

The patch is apparently in -rc5, but that kernel, while it doesn't
oops, fails to authenticate:

Any idea what's going on here?
