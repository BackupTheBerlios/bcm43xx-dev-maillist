</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As Michael correctly points out, this patch substitutes one bug for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another. The current bug affects every bcm43xx device with an rfkill
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch except BCM4306/3, and the new bug only affects BCM4306/3 users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a kill switch. As the latter group may be the empty set, I think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the trade-off is worth it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An additional complication is that I do not have the hardware to test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the PPC faults. The OP of Bugzilla #14181 has been helpful; however,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it takes several tries to get a fix, we might miss the 2.6.32
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; release, which would introduce a significant regression.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For the above reasons, I am suggesting that this patch be accepted and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pushed to mainline even though it has faults.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, hmmm...ok, we have two or three problems here... :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One is whether or not to take this patch.  Normally it is against
</I>&gt;<i> policy or whatnot to trade one bug for another.  In this case,
</I>&gt;<i> it seems we would fix a real bug in exchange for a theorhetical
</I>&gt;<i> bug that we believe no one actually has.  Is that the case?  If so,
</I>&gt;<i> that might be acceptable.
</I>
The patch reduces the number of affected users, so it's probably OK.
I can't say if this reduces it to zero, though.
The real fix for all this crapola is to rewrite the b43 init to never
shutdown the device (or fix rfkill to never shutdown the device completely
and instead add a rfkill hook. But that's not going to happen, because
people don't like it. Although keeping the wireless device up just for
monitoring a stupid pushbutton is not acceptable behavior to me.)

&gt;<i> The other problem is a work/patch flow issue.  I have occasionally
</I>&gt;<i> (some would say too often) snagged a patch directly from this list.
</I>
I suggest we move as much stuff as possible _off_ this list. It's
horribly unreliable, it mangles messages and it's slow.
So it's a good idea to add CC linux-wireless list on the very first reply.

I think, however, it's always a good idea to resend a patch after the
discussion has calmed down. It's way easier for the upstream maintainer.
