&gt;<i> As Michael correctly points out, this patch substitutes one bug for

</I>&gt;<i> switch except BCM4306/3, and the new bug only affects BCM4306/3 users

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An additional complication is that I do not have the hardware to test
</I>&gt;<i> the PPC faults. The OP of Bugzilla #14181 has been helpful; however,
</I>&gt;<i> if it takes several tries to get a fix, we might miss the 2.6.32
</I>&gt;<i> release, which would introduce a significant regression.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the above reasons, I am suggesting that this patch be accepted and
</I>&gt;<i> pushed to mainline even though it has faults.

Well, hmmm...ok, we have two or three problems here... :-)

One is whether or not to take this patch.  Normally it is against
policy or whatnot to trade one bug for another.  In this case,
it seems we would fix a real bug in exchange for a theorhetical
bug that we believe no one actually has.  Is that the case?  If so,
that might be acceptable.

The other problem is a work/patch flow issue.  I have occasionally
(some would say too often) snagged a patch directly from this list.
But in general I have waited for Michael to repost the patches to
linux-wireless before merging them.  As such, I'm unaccustomed to
collecting patches from here.  In any event, most patches should be
posted to linux-wireless for wider review before merging.  That would
normally be the maintainer's job, but we are effectively without one
for b43 now.  I don't suppose anyone wants to stand-up?

The third problem (related to the second) is that I missed the
original post, so if you don't mind I'd like you to resend it (to
linux-wireless)! :-)

Thanks,

John
