That's the unfair part.

Yeah, but that doesn't mean that either hack is acceptable. It just means that my time is limited
and I added this non-issue (which I still think it is) to the very bottom of my priority list.

&gt;<i> After ~22 hours if I'm not mistaken (yes, less than 24...) John, who had previously expressed his intentions to merge the patch [5], picked it for wireless-2.6.

My impression was, that if the maintainer rejects a patch and asks for a new version,
the upstream maintainer must not take the patch until the maintainer acked the new version.
It seems I was wrong, though.

&gt;<i> My point here is that there's no reason for such strong words concerning the quality of the patch code. It's really not that bad for such wording.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure that if the patch was really crap it would have been immediately NAK'ed by you or by any sane maintainer.
</I>
It _was_ immediately NAK'ed by me. I did not know that I need to NAK
every single new version of a patch explicitely.
I thought NAK-ing a patch would put it into some special state that only an explicit ACK could
take it out of.
