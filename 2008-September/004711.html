Nono. I will try to explain it once again. It's really easy.

Think of b43 having two independent registers for rfkill. (the actual hardware
is different, but that doesn't matter. It's a driver internal implementation detail).
One of these registers is readonly and it does indicate the physical rfkill button state.
If that register indicates BLOCK, we can't do anything about it. The radio is blocked.
However, we can still write to the second register and turn the radio off through
that, too. We can also write to the second register to turn the radio on, _but_ it won't
physically turn on until the physical button is pressed and the first register changes
to Unblocked.
So you say that rfkill should only be notified about changes in the first read-only
hardware intication bit? If that's the case, it would be possible to turn the radio off
through mac80211 calls (using the read-write register), but still have rfkill think it's
unblocked.
