<PRE>Even with the latest stable linux kernel 2.6.26.5, the b43 driver has
trouble authenticating--mainly after cold boots after long periods of
being offline. My AP doesn't have any encryption, and the problem
exists regardless of my proximity to it.

The system log would look like this:

20:52:32 firmware: requesting b43/ucode5.fw
20:52:32 firmware: requesting b43/pcm5.fw
20:52:32 firmware: requesting b43/b0g0initvals5.fw

20:52:46 wlan0: authenticate with AP 00:11:95:be:b5:a9
20:52:46 b43-phy0: Radio turned off by software
20:52:46 /etc/init.d/net.wlan0[1766]: ERROR: net.wlan0 failed to start

It does /eventually/ authenticate, after MANY retries. Usually about
10-20. (I currently have a bash script that iterates through 30
retries :P). Sometimes it won't even work after 30 consecutive retries.
Incidentally, if I take a break for a minute or so, and then try to
authenticate, it usually tends to work :/.


The successful attempt would look something like:

20:56:08 b43-phy0: Radio turned on by software
20:56:08 wlan0: Initial auth_alg=0
20:56:08 wlan0: authenticate with AP 00:11:95:be:b5:a9

   transaction=2 status=0)
20:56:08 wlan0: authenticated
20:56:08 wlan0: associate with AP 00:11:95:be:b5:a9
20:56:08 wlan0: authentication frame received from 00:11:95:be:b5:a9,
   but not in authenticate state - ignored
20:56:08 wlan0: RX AssocResp from 00:11:95:be:b5:a9 (capab=0x421
   status=0 aid=2)
20:56:08 wlan0: associated
20:56:08 wlan0: switched to short barker preamble
   (BSSID=00:11:95:be:b5:a9)
20:56:11 wlan0: Initial auth_alg=0
20:56:11 wlan0: authenticate with AP 00:11:95:be:b5:a9
20:56:11 wlan0: RX authentication from 00:11:95:be:b5:a9 (alg=0
   transaction=2 status=0)
20:56:11 wlan0: authenticated
20:56:11 wlan0: associate with AP 00:11:95:be:b5:a9
20:56:11 wlan0: RX ReassocResp from 00:11:95:be:b5:a9 (capab=0x421
    status=0 aid=2)
20:56:11 wlan0: associated
20:56:11 wlan0: Initial auth_alg=0
20:56:11 wlan0: authenticate with AP 00:11:95:be:b5:a9
20:56:11 wlan0: RX authentication from 00:11:95:be:b5:a9 (alg=0
   transaction=2 status=0)
20:56:11 wlan0: authenticated
20:56:11 wlan0: associate with AP 00:11:95:be:b5:a9
20:56:11 wlan0: RX ReassocResp from 00:11:95:be:b5:a9 (capab=0x421
   status=0 aid=2)
20:56:11 wlan0: associated

Notice that there is one &quot;RX AssocResp&quot; message, then it would claim to
be associated, and then three seconds later it would continue to try to
authenticate, and receive two other &quot;RX ReassocResp&quot; messages, each of
which would produce another &quot;associated&quot; message. This triple
broadcasting for authentication seems a little strange to me?


My wlan0 card is:
