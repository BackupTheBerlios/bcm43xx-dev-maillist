Tex,

Thanks for the heads-up. I have also tried the Broadcom driver with
little success.

The main problems that I encountered were:

1) Intermittent disconnections with AP
2) VERY occasionally, it would refuse to connect to the AP completely,
but most times it would succeed until I would hit (1).
3) Once something went wrong (anything), it remained that way until I
rebooted, despite my best efforts.
4) I could never manage to start an SSH connection with this driver, no
idea why. It would return with &quot;no route to host&quot;.

I would communicate these problems with Broadcom, but experience tells
me that this will fall on deaf ears (someone correct me if I'm wrong
here).

For now, I'll stick with ndiswrapper (which works, albeit with a few
small bugs and no monitor mode), and keep listening out for a better
alternative.

I do appreciate you letting me know about the driver, there are likely
to be others who have not tried it as well.

Sean
