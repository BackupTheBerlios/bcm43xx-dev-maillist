Maybe we just miscommunicated, or maybe I misunderstood something
about the reverse engineering process. I am very new to this project.

I know. Allow me to clarify my train of thought:

* Specs are created by reverse engineering of a binary blob.

* After development of b43*, many can happily use the drivers. \o/

* As it turns out, b43* can be made even more reliable by doing
  things slightly different than what the specs say. Case in point
  looping a little longer.

At this point, if there are only/mostly benefits, I don't see why
deviating from the specs is bad - after all they &quot;only&quot; document
another driver, right?
