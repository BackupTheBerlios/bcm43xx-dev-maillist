</I>If I understand him correctly he's suggesting that there could be BETTER 
values than those used by the reference driver.  In other words, yes, 
B43/B43-Legacy are based on the RE of the Windows driver but perhaps 
there are better values that improve behavior beyond that of the 
original driver.

He didn't say the following but I will: It's also true that there are 
edge cases that RE won't catch without repeated arduous testing in 
adverse conditions, and there may be code in the reference driver that 
will therefore won't end up in the specs.  This means that behavioral 
improvements and/or performance gains in B43/B43-Legacy that can be 
gained without getting into those edge cases are worthy of consideration 
(or maybe specially labeled code).

Just my two farthings worth.
