<PRE>Hey All,


First of all, a quick introduction of myself. In general, I'm more of
a sysadmin than a kernel developer, though in the odd case I've
tracked down a few driver or FOSS-project bugs here and there (webcams
and gatekeeper proejcts, small bugs usually caused by simple
mistakes). So while I've never really delved heavily into writing
drivers, I can at least do a step-by-step testing in many cases.

I'm joining the list because:

a) I have a bunch of laptops with Broadcomm cards, which - thanks to
you developers - now happily work without me needing to use
NDISwrapper
b) I have a newer laptop with a Broadcomm card which seems to be
something of an enigma at the moment.

Now onward to (b), and what is currently one of the driving causes
behind my joining this list. I notice that on the &quot;LinuxWireless&quot;
page, the origins/status of the BCM4322 chipset seems to be somewhat
unknown. The current comment in the unsupported section is:

* BCM 4322 - We are working on support for this device (FIXME: what
the hell is a BCM4322? &#8211;mb)

If you haven't sighted this card in the wild, I currently have one in
my newer HP laptop: A tx5254ca (Canadian TX2500 series, one of the
reversible-screen tablet jobs). These went up for sale in a bunch of
places at Future Shop and Best Buy, etc, so we may be seeing more
Linux users with this chipset in the future.

I'd be happy to lend and support I can in supplying info/dumps/etc and
testing the driver on this chipset as needed. Broadcomm actually has
their own Linux/closed-source driver that somewhat works for this
chipset (wl), but at the moment it's buggy as heck and tends to
regularly disconnect and reconnect. I'd love to see the B43 driver get
this chipset working, both so that I can have a working card and so
that users can use a &quot;true&quot; FOSS driver rather than a buggy
closed-source one.


Regards,


Tyler Aviss
