I do not dispute that rfkill-handling in b43 is broken; however, prior
to the commit in question, it worked.

I also think we can agree that we need to get it working before 2.6.27
is released. If the small fix now is the reversion of bc19d6e, then I
think this is the correct path. We will then have a couple of weeks to
get the code working correctly before the 2.6.28 merge starts.

I admit that I never tested any of the RFKILL patches as they went in.
One of the reasons is that the development process seemed rather
untidy to an outsider, and I wasn't sure that any of the code would
ever be in the kernel. As such, it snuck up on me. I'll not let that
happen again. After the reversion, I will again test any suggested
code changes, but do not expect me to work out any of the changes. I
have enough to do.
