<PRE>Hello all,

Before I go any further, please do not read this as criticism, I would
just like to explain my reasoning before making a request...

The situation as I see it is this:

BCM4328 cards are becoming more popular, and obviously support for it in
bcm43xx is underway (which is great, by the way). However, the rise in
popularity means more people turning up on the lists and IRC asking the
same old questions.

When I realised that a laptop I was given required a BCM4328 compatible
driver, the first place I looked was here:

<A HREF="http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/?go=devices">http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/?go=devices</A>

In fact, I would suggest that this is the most common starting point for
anyone who does not know much about wireless drivers and would prefer to
avoid asking FAQ's on discussion forums. Any repeated questions on the
lists or IRC could be reduced dramatically by stating them on the
website.

This page does not list BCM4328 anywhere, it may list the Dell wireless
card model that my laptop has built-in, but I don't wish to open my
laptop up to find out which model it is labelled as, if it is labelled
at all. So people like myself, Javier and Jos&#233; come to the lists and IRC
to find out about support. I'm fairly sure we are not the first to ask,
by a long-short, and this has built some tension over time so responses
like &quot;DONT ASK, THERE IS NO SUPPORT!&quot; are offered.

What I propose is that the Devices page is made more accessible to those
who are less technical and want to help out. Does anyone object to
making it a Wiki so that people can easily update it to help prevent the
amount of &quot;is my card supported&quot; traffic on the lists?

Sean
