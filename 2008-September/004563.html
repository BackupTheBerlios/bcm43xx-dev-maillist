You may be better off writing to linux-wireless about it.  As far as I
know, there was some botched update made to the tree made in the recent
days, but it have been fixed.

Anyway, many trees are updated in a non-linear way.  This means that you
may need to reset the tree to the remote tip:

git-reset --hard wireless-testing/master

This will lose your uncommitted changes.  If you have your changes in a
separate branch, you should be able to rebase your branch on top on the
newly updated version.

I recommend that you use StGIT for local patches.  While not strictly
required, it's a tool that is primarily designed to working with
patchsets.  It will pop all patches before updates, so that you should
be able to do any dangerous git commands and then push your patches on
top of the result.

If you have any advanced questions about git, please ask them in the git
list.
