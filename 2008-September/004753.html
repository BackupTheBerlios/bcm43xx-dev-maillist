<PRE>Fellow bcm-users,

I have had this issue with my BCM4311 rev 01 for a couple of months 
now.  It seems whenever I am connected to a wireless network supported 
by multiple APs with the same SSID (as is the case whenever I am at home 
or at school), b43 can't seem to tell which one to stay connected to and 
thus is continuously disconnecting and reconnecting over and over.  I 
have provided my dmesg output below, you can see every time the 
connection to an AP is lost and it tries to connect to a different one. 
If there is any other information that developers would need for me to 
provide in an attempt to get this resolved, please let me know.
