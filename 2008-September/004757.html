</I>&gt;<i> please let me know.
</I>
I also have this problem (I think, and posted about it here a few days
ago), with my 4318--but mostly (only) when first trying to establish
the link. Although in my case, it only tries (miserably) to authenticate
with my correct AP. But the pattern and error messages are the same.
Lots of authentication attempts, even lots of actual &quot;authenticatED&quot;
messages, followed immediately by MORE authentication attempts and
&quot;deauthenticated(reason=3)&quot;. And this repeats MANY times.

Although eventually it does connect; although dhcpcd usually has trouble
obtaining a lease after this, and I ended up putting it in a loop in a
&quot;postfail&quot; script. It's a mess! But it's a lot better than it was a
year ago ;).
