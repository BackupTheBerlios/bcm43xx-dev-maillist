<PRE>According to the specs on the actual laptop, it's a &quot;Draft N&quot; router.
I had thought that the b/g part would be pretty much the same as other
adaptors (and work) with the &quot;N&quot; part being added functionality (that
I can't use regardless, since my router is only B/G). However I
haven't had much luck getting the sucker to work under linux just yet,
except for the works-but-disconnects-regularly driver supplied by
Broadcomm.

I was hoping to at least have some luck with ndiswrapper but even that
one hasn't been giving me much love with this card. Luckily I've got
an old USB-G adaptor kicking around that I can use in the meantime.

Let me know if there's any other information you need...

Here's the dump from &quot;lspci -vv&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) I have a newer laptop with a Broadcomm card which seems to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something of an enigma at the moment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now onward to (b), and what is currently one of the driving causes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behind my joining this list. I notice that on the &quot;LinuxWireless&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page, the origins/status of the BCM4322 chipset seems to be somewhat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unknown. The current comment in the unsupported section is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * BCM 4322 - We are working on support for this device (FIXME: what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the hell is a BCM4322? &#8211;mb)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd be happy to lend and support I can in supplying info/dumps/etc and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> testing the driver on this chipset as needed. Broadcomm actually has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their own Linux/closed-source driver that somewhat works for this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chipset (wl), but at the moment it's buggy as heck and tends to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regularly disconnect and reconnect. I'd love to see the B43 driver get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this chipset working, both so that I can have a working card and so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that users can use a &quot;true&quot; FOSS driver rather than a buggy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> closed-source one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you issue an 'lspci -nnv' for one of these devices, what is the PCI ID
</I>&gt;<i> for the BCM4322?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that this is an 802.11n device. If so, the reverse engineering for
</I>&gt;<i> this device is going slowly. We had one person working on decompiling a MIPS

</I>&gt;<i> busy with working on the LP PHY (an 802.11g variant) for a couple of reasons
</I>&gt;<i> - it is a lot more like the other G PHYs, and I personally have one of the
</I>&gt;<i> devices. Once the LP PHY is working, then I will start on the N PHY code.
