From a usability perspective anything but a single control at the
core is utterly confusing and must IMO be avoided at all cost.

Seems complete. I like it.


b43 radio state in hardware is a simple logic nor; when both bits are
0 the radio is on. There are many different ways for the user to
signal radio enable or disable; radio control is not symmetric.

I think the confusion may come from the two separate methods of
disabling radio in b43 hardware. There can be both a button suitable
for rfkill integration, and a button that overrides whatever software
tries to do. The latter is notification only (but pressing it does
generate a notification, right? Or is it polled?) and should maybe
not be handled by rfkill (I too am not very familiar with the rfkill
design :\) but must certainly be reflected in LEDs.

Again, LEDs _must_ follow hardware state. Usability. I think the
simplest way to accomplish that is logic that funnels into one single
radio setting and the LED following that setting.

The twist is that radio state is not only controlled by the kernel,
but also by hardware.
