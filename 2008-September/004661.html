I didn't say it was not possible. What I said is that _ONLY_ the
operator's finger could change the state, just like in your laptop.
Thus it makes absolutely no difference what state RFKILL thinks it is
in. The driver knows what state the software wants, and can read but
not write the hardware state. There has to be a bug in RFKILL that got
exposed when this commit was included. This regression needs to be
fixed ASAP, otherwise 2.6.27 will be released with it. If the RFKILL
guys want to fix their bug, I'll be happy to test code, but not now.
