</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * BCM 4322 - We are working on support for this device (FIXME: what
</I>&gt;<i> the hell is a BCM4322? &#8211;mb)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be happy to lend and support I can in supplying info/dumps/etc and
</I>&gt;<i> testing the driver on this chipset as needed. Broadcomm actually has
</I>&gt;<i> their own Linux/closed-source driver that somewhat works for this

</I>&gt;<i> regularly disconnect and reconnect. I'd love to see the B43 driver get
</I>&gt;<i> this chipset working, both so that I can have a working card and so
</I>&gt;<i> that users can use a &quot;true&quot; FOSS driver rather than a buggy
</I>&gt;<i> closed-source one.
</I>
When you issue an 'lspci -nnv' for one of these devices, what is the 
PCI ID for the BCM4322?

I suspect that this is an 802.11n device. If so, the reverse 
engineering for this device is going slowly. We had one person working 
on decompiling a MIPS Broadcom driver, but he has been busy with other 
things lately. I have been busy with working on the LP PHY (an 802.11g 
variant) for a couple of reasons - it is a lot more like the other G 
PHYs, and I personally have one of the devices. Once the LP PHY is 
working, then I will start on the N PHY code.
