<PRE>You know, people read this list TO HELP PEOPLE.  That's right.  I'm up 
at 2307 my time hoping that I can provide some information that will 
help you get your bcm43xx device functional, or that failing that I can 
help you provide information so the folks that work between the 
firmware, the reverse-engineered speficiations, and the driver can make 
it work.

NOTHING would please me more than to see your device work.
I feel I would not be happy if it were not to work.
And yet, unfortunately, in this imperfect world I must work with some 
imperfections... like....

Zero diagnostic information.

Ndiswrapper typically works in about 5 seconds, so not only no 
diagnostic information, but your &quot;BS programmer&quot; is 4 hours 59 minutes 
and 55 seconds full of &quot;BS&quot;.

You don't mention your kernel version.

You don't include a uname -a  or a dmesg | grep bcm43

Now let's talk English
&quot;chip talking&quot; -- meaningless
&quot;a kernel build&quot; -- meaningless
&quot;wireless was showing&quot; -- meaningless
&quot;wifi switch light&quot; -- meaningless
&quot;not making up to&quot; -- meaningless
&quot;actually use the signal&quot; -- meaningless
&quot;it suddenly stops&quot; -- almost meaningless.  SOmething that might have 
been previously defined (but wasn't) no longer words.
&quot;it's on again&quot; -- same comment as above
&quot;Any clues&quot; -- no, you don't have any

SO... I'd say &quot;good luck&quot; but it looks like you don't have any of that 
either.
