Ok i am going to try to be nice, as i myself have been chewed out by
this forum before (improper email reply edict), and as i had a similar
problem i think, but as has been explained before its hard to tell.
First there is a transmit power problem that has been hard to fix
(correct me if i have misunderstood some of the other emails that flow
though here) this is going to make connecting to some networks very
flaky if not impossible when you are father away.

As for the ability to connect sometimes and not others, it is
something called i need to use the new kernel.  Or use rmmod bcm43xx a
lot.  If you are using a distros kernel, it is very likely that it
wont work, so i direct your attention toward www.kernel.org.  At the
time that my system was exhibiting that behavior, i applied this patch
and it went away
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2007-February/003819.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2007-February/003819.html</A>
.  With the newer kernels, it should not be a problem. I still have
problems when i am to far away from my AP, but in a reasonable range,
it is very functional.

a uname -a would be helpful
lspci | grep Broadcom
dmesg | grep bcm43xx

Also that tidbit about the light was completely useless, it is
hardware not software (the filament in your ceiling light does not
effect whether or not the wall switch opens and closes)

If wont use the bcm43xx driver you are not going to find what people
say here very useful.

Well that is my best guess at what you were trying to say.
