Under Linux, it is important to list your kernel version in addition to your distro version for two 
reasons. Firstly, there are so many distros that one cannot remember what each one includes. 
Secondly, the kernel may have been updated independently of the distro. For example, I'm running the 
x86-64 version of openSUSE 10.2 for which the standard kernel is 2.6.18; however, I'm running kernel 
2.6.22. You use the command 'uname -r' (without the quotes) to get the kernel version.

As stated above, I'm not a Fedora user and I may get some of the following wrong.

Have you installed the firmware for your bcm43xx card? If not, you will need to do the following as 
root:

Find your Windows driver. It will likely be named bcmwl5.sys.

Issue the following commands:

yum install bcm43xx-fwcutter
bcm43xx-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware XXXXXX.sys

where XXXXXX is replaced by the path and name of your Windows driver.

If you send your kernel version, we will be able to get you the rest of the way.

Larry
