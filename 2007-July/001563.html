<PRE>Hello, Larry!

First of all, many thanks for porting the v3 driver to mac80211!

Sounds good.

&gt;<i> 2. Once the problems have been cleared and ssb is in -mm, it gets sent there as a port from softmac 
</I>&gt;<i> to mac80211 for the current bcm43xx. An additional consideration is that a port from softmac to 
</I>&gt;<i> mac80211 will be more easily merged than if it looks like a new driver.
</I>
I would prefer if the name stayed the same, but it shouldn't be a big
deal.

&gt;<i> 3. If the port of softmac to mac80211 is merged before Michael's driver, it will be known as bcm43xx 
</I>&gt;<i> with bcm43xx-mac80211 remaining in wireless-dev.
</I>
Yes, that's what I mean, keep it &quot;bcm43xx&quot; unless renaming it is the
condition for acceptance.

&gt;<i> 4. Once bcm43xx-mac80211 gets merged to mainline, then Michael's driver should become bcm43xx and my 
</I>&gt;<i> driver gets its PCI IDs stripped to the 802.11b-only devices and once again becomes bcm4301. This 
</I>&gt;<i> name change for Michael's driver would cause some disruption for current users as their firmware 
</I>&gt;<i> would have the wrong name/version. That might be too much of a problem.
</I>
Actually, the common practice is that the new driver that doesn't
supplant the old driver immediately and for the whole range of hardware
gets a new name.  Think CONFIG_IDE vs CONFIG_ATA and eepro100 vs e100.

Also, we could introduce a kernel option to enable support for new
devices in your driver.

&gt;<i> I think this is a path that always has a stable driver with at least moderate performance in 
</I>&gt;<i> mainline throughout the entire transformation.
</I>
That's a very good goal.

I would also consider the option to use different names for v3 and v4
firmware.  I have a file /etc/modprobe.d/bcm43xx that reads

options bcm43xx fwpostfix=.3
options bcm43xx_mac80211 fwpostfix=.4

but we cannot expect every distro (let alone every user) to take care of
the naming conflict.  Users don't expect the need to rename firmware,
and we shouldn't create a problem for them.
