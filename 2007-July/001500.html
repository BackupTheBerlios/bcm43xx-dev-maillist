It should have taken him only one kernel build to get the 4318 working
with the open source driver bcm43xx driver shipped with the latest -rc
kernel.

Eh yeah. No driver loaded means no working network device. Hardly a
surprise, I'd say.

If you're using ndiswrapper right now, you're at the vendor's whim. We
don't have the source of the Windows driver you loaded, so we can't
help you. You *might* try talking to your vendor, but I don't think
they consider Linux + ndiswrapper as a supported configuration for
their driver. They joys of proprietary software...

If you want people over here to be able to help you, use the open
source driver.

Oh, and please be precise: your subject says you're using a bcm4312,
but in the body you talk about a bcm4318.
