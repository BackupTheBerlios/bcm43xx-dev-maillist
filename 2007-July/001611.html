<PRE>The new driver for Broadcom wireless devices is now available for testing. The file is
<A HREF="ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.net/patches/BCM4301_for_2.6.22.patch.">ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.net/patches/BCM4301_for_2.6.22.patch.</A> As the name implies, it is to be 
applied to the 2.6.22 or 2.6.22.1 source. The ssb driver is included in the patch. To test it, 
follow these steps:

1. Download the file and patch the source. Unfortunately, the current code for mac80211 in 
wireless-2.6 and Linus's tree is not functional with this driver. When we solve this problem and you 
can apply a patch to either of those trees, I'll post that news here.

2. Configure it with 'make xconfig' or 'make menuconfig'. In &quot;Networking/Wireless&quot;, select the
mac80211 IEEE80211 networking stack. Deselect the other generic IEEE802.11 stack. Under
Drivers/Network device support/Wireless LAN&quot;, select the BCM4301 driver with debugging support.

3. Build and install the kernel and modules. This version uses V3 firmware, the same as
bcm43xx-softmac. Although it is planned that this driver will eventually support only the
802.11b-devices (BCM4301 and BCM4303), it currently supports all 802.11b and 802.11g devices.

Performance of the new driver is better, than bcm43xx. The following transfer results using iperf 
with a server on my LAN are as shown below with the rates given in Mbs with transmitting first and 
receiving second:

Bitrate		BCM4311

1		0.83/8.17
2		1.61/10.4
5.5		3.82/12.6
6		4.28/15.8
9		5.93/16.4
11		6.23/13.3
18		10.1/17.8
24		12.3/17.1
36		15.2/17.5
48		17.2/17.2
54		17.9/17.8

As you can see, performance does not drop off at the highest rates. This is the first time
I have been able to get a reading at 54 Mbs.

I think it might be possible to get this driver into 2.6.23-mm, which would make it possible for it 
to be merged into 2.6.24. If bcm43xx-mac80211 is ready at that time, this driver will be restricted 
to 802.11b devices. If not, it will be pushed as a port of bcm43xx.

PLease report your results - good or bad. In particular, I'm interested in any warnings and/or oops's.

Thanks,

Larry
