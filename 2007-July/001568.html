I really like the minimalism of b43, which plays well with b44 and
p54 :)

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, we could introduce a kernel option to enable support for new

</I>&gt;<i> Does that make any sense?  It would seem to be applicable to a number

Yes, I used to hearing complains that orinoco steals IDs from hostap.
Then it became popular to blacklist orinoco modules.  Quite a disgrace
for the driver!  Having &quot;weak&quot; IDs for Prism based cards would have
avoided it.

But please realize that the problem goes far beyond PCI.  Perhaps you
have heard of CONFIG_USB_LIBUSUAL, which selects the best driver for USB
storage devices, either the slow but reliable ub, or the SCSI based
usb-storage, which it too fast for some cheap sticks.

It even has a parameter called &quot;bias&quot;, which allows to control how
conservative the algorithm should be.  That would be hard to emulate
with &quot;weak entries&quot;, but I hope that &quot;bias&quot; is an overkill.

&gt;<i> Yes, we should probably start using a default value for fwpostfix.
</I>&gt;<i> As dwmw2 suggested, it would also be nice to fall back to an empty
</I>&gt;<i> fwpostfix if the firmware is not found w/ the default extension.
</I>
Yes, that sounds good.
