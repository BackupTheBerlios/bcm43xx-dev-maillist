<PRE>Not a developer, just a tester, and not a very good one... but I am a 
_USER_ so here's my take.

The USERs don't want to know what card they have or what driver they 
need or PCI IDs.  That's all stuff that makes them say &quot;Linux Bad, 
*****s good.&quot; (Yeah I know, there's the whole driver moreass there and 
PCI VENs too) but anyway...

The driver should have a name that reflects its use and capabilities.

For example, bcm43xx is a reasonable name.  I don't like it personally 
because the google links to the site (berlios.de) that tell me that's 
why I need took a while to find but that's just semantics.

bcm43xx_mac80211 is a less reasonable name.  With respect to the coders 
who have put time into making this usable on by 4306 and almost usable 
on my 4311 I can say that I appreciate the effort... but the name needs 
work.

If I was king of driver package naming, the driver that works with v3 
and v4 firmware and supports crypto functions would be... 
broadcom80211bg or bcm80211g
The driver that only works with v3 (aka bcm43xx) broadcomv3
The driver that only works with v4 (aka bcm43xx_mac80211) broadcomv4

As time advances and bcb43xx_mac80211/broadcomv4 is brought to spec so 
it works great... its code would be integrated into 
broadcom80211g/bcm80211g.

That's my thinking.  As a USER.  As a linux advocate and zealot.

I can tell you there are three things that are the #1 hindrance to 
massive Linux adoption
1. proprietary video cards
2. proprietary network cards
3. the various sundry and astonishingly in-the-way and annoying 
network-managers.

If you can solve #2... you've eliminated 33% of the problem and maybe 
even helped with #3.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, this is probably worthwhile for those wishing to avoid PCI ID
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conflicts between the drivers.  I have also been speculating that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps we need an option for a secondary PCI ID table, so that a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But please realize that the problem goes far beyond PCI.  Perhaps you

</I>&gt;<i> storage devices, either the slow but reliable ub, or the SCSI based
</I>&gt;<i> usb-storage, which it too fast for some cheap sticks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It even has a parameter called &quot;bias&quot;, which allows to control how

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, we should probably start using a default value for fwpostfix.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As dwmw2 suggested, it would also be nice to fall back to an empty

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that sounds good.
