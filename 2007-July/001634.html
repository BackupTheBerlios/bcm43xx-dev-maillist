Your card has a BCM4311 chip, the same as mine, but it is a different implementation. From your 
dmesg output, we find:

PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 0000:03:00.0. Probably buggy MP table.
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:03:00.0 to 64
bcm43xx: Chip ID 0x4311, rev 0x2
bcm43xx: Number of cores: 4
bcm43xx: Core 0: ID 0x800, rev 0x13, vendor 0x4243
bcm43xx: Core 1: ID 0x812, rev 0xd, vendor 0x4243
bcm43xx: Unsupported 80211 core revision 13
bcm43xx: Core 2: ID 0x817, rev 0x4, vendor 0x4243
bcm43xx: Core 3: ID 0x820, rev 0x5, vendor 0x4243
bcm43xx: PHY connected
bcm43xx: Detected PHY: Analog: 4, Type 2, Revision 9
bcm43xx: Invalid PHY Revision 9
bcm43xx: Detected Radio: ID: 2205017f (Manuf: 17f Ver: 2050 Rev: 2)
bcm43xx: Radio turned off

The first problem is that interrupts will not be processed for this device. It may be a buggy MP 
table, incorrect firmware, or some other problem. I don't know at this point. In addition, it is 
unlikely that V3 firmware was ever written for this device - thus it will need to use 
bcm43xx-mac80211 with V4 firmware. As you have seen in the messages from Joseph Jezak, drivers for 
this device have not yet been reverse engineered.

Sorry that we will not be able to help you with this problem for some time. This is the result of 
the total lack of cooperation from Broadcom, and too little manpower for the reverse engineering 
effort. We welcome volunteers.

Larry
