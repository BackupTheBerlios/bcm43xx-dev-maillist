Yes, this preserves stability for happy bcm43xx users.  Still taking
suggestions for the new name for bcm43xx-mac80211... :-)

&gt;<i> Also, we could introduce a kernel option to enable support for new
</I>&gt;<i> devices in your driver.
</I> 
Yes, this is probably worthwhile for those wishing to avoid PCI ID
conflicts between the drivers.  I have also been speculating that
perhaps we need an option for a secondary PCI ID table, so that a
driver could support a large range of PCI IDs but then gracefully
bow-out if another driver had a certain ID in its primary table.
Does that make any sense?  It would seem to be applicable to a number
of drivers in the kernel.

&gt;<i> I would also consider the option to use different names for v3 and v4
</I>&gt;<i> firmware.  I have a file /etc/modprobe.d/bcm43xx that reads
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> options bcm43xx fwpostfix=.3
</I>&gt;<i> options bcm43xx_mac80211 fwpostfix=.4
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but we cannot expect every distro (let alone every user) to take care of
</I>&gt;<i> the naming conflict.  Users don't expect the need to rename firmware,
</I>&gt;<i> and we shouldn't create a problem for them.
</I>
Yes, we should probably start using a default value for fwpostfix.
As dwmw2 suggested, it would also be nice to fall back to an empty
fwpostfix if the firmware is not found w/ the default extension.
