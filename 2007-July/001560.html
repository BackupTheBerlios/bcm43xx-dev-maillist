I agree. Let's treat this as a port, as soon as it's stable. By the way, I
hope I'll be able to contribute again starting on July, 25.
 
&gt;<i> As for the name, if we treat this as a port of the current driver to

</I>&gt;<i> If so, we need a new name for the v4-based driver -- &quot;bcm43xxtoo&quot;? :-)
</I>
Should the ported driver support 802.11g devices as well, it should be
called bcm43xx, IMHO. Else, IIRC, we already discussed that and it should
be called bcm4301. bcm43xx-mac80211 could be renamed to &quot;bcm43xx-v4&quot;, it
would be more meaningful than &quot;bcm43xtoo&quot;, maybe.

&gt;<i> Regarding hardware support, I have begun to lean towards having
</I>&gt;<i> the v3 driver continue to support all the hardware it does now.
</I>
I agree. But I would wait a little more time, I mean, when the ported driver
is stable, then let's consider the status of &quot;bcm43xx-v4&quot;. Michael is
actually making some progress, even if - sadly - he's alone right now. 

The final plan should be something like this:
1) bcm43xx gets stable and merged;
2) bcm43xx-mac80211 is renamed to bcm43xx-v4 and doesn't get merged;
3) when bcm43xx-v4 gets stable, the PCI IDs list of bcm43xx gets stripped
down and it is renamed to bcm4301, while bcm43xx-v4 is renamed to bcm43xx.

This could lead to some troubles. The other possible plan:
1) bcm43xx-mac80211 gets stable and merged, while bcm43xx is renamed to
bcm4301 and its PCI IDs list stripped down;
would sound a lot simpler. Even if the first plan could be better for users
and distributions. So I'd say, let's have a stable driver at least, before
to take a decision.

&gt;<i> What exactly do we gain from using the v4 firmware?
</I>
Other than crypto hardware, support for 802.11n devices, and maybe 802.11a
devices too (I started working on that but I'm not doing that right now).

&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm glad to hear we are making progress on this front.
</I>&gt;<i> Good job, Larry!
</I>
Me too! Good job!
