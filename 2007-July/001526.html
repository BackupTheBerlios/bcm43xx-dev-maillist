</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does BS mean in this context? 
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>A B.S. Computer Science  degree..  In other words somebody certified 
smart, as in in much better shape for this than Yours Truly.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Several of us try very hard to make this forum helpful, and not chew out the OP, but it is very hard 
</I>&gt;<i> to diagnose a problem when crucial information is missing. Suppose I asked for help in diagnosing my 
</I>&gt;<i> Ford truck and I didn't tell you that it is a diesel, and I didn't even say whether it started, or 
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>And that is the reason I hope to find help from folks that have the 
chops to make this stuff work.  Coding details are difficult enough, I 
imagine, for people that use them every day, what with the various 
languages, shells, routines,...  I can't justify the time right now just 
to learn bash.  For all I know I'd feed that diesel with gasoline and 
blow us all up!
&gt;<i>  For the record, diagnosis of problems require the kernel version (uname -r), any patches that 
</I>&gt;<i> have been applied, the results from the command 'dmesg | grep bcm43xx', information about encryption 
</I>&gt;<i> on the access point, and any additional software being used to connect (NetworkManager, etc.). As 
</I>&gt;<i> stated below,
</I>I make a note of it, thank you.
&gt;<i>  if you want to use ndiswrapper, go elsewhere. We have done a lot of work to avoid that!!
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>See?  For all I knew the two worked together, either the wrapper or the 
cutter, and until last week I didn't know that it was either/or.  With 
your mate's help, I have put in a few hours trying to make the system 
run with the cutter, and Joe tried to make it work as well, before going 
with the wrapper approach.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for the ability to connect sometimes and not others, it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something called i need to use the new kernel.  Or use rmmod bcm43xx a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lot.  If you are using a distros kernel, it is very likely that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wont work, so i direct your attention toward www.kernel.org.  At the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time that my system was exhibiting that behavior, i applied this patch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and it went away
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2007-February/003819.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2007-February/003819.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .  With the newer kernels, it should not be a problem. I still have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems when i am to far away from my AP, but in a reasonable range,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is very functional.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>Yes, that's basically what Joe did:  downloaded a fresh kernel and 
compiled / built it to work with the driver, and still needed the 
wrapper.  I don't know why, or for that matter how, when, where, or who.
&gt;&gt;<i> a uname -a would be helpful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lspci | grep Broadcom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dmesg | grep bcm43xx
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also that tidbit about the light was completely useless, it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardware not software (the filament in your ceiling light does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effect whether or not the wall switch opens and closes)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>When the wireless stopped working the light on the switch at the near 
edge of the notebook stopped working also.  I tried several times but 
could not start the wireless channel in Network Manager.  Then I saw the 
light working again, opened N.M., and was able to start the service.  
Maybe in this case that light is on a power detector and there was an 
open switch at or ahead of  the ct/diode/transistor...
&gt;&gt;<i> If wont use the bcm43xx driver you are not going to find what people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say here very useful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>So what it looks like then is that until I have learned enough linux-ese 
to be able to access the technical pages, understand the difference (??) 
between a native driver and a bcm43xx driver, and why there's a notice 
in the F7 installation startup that there is no Broadcom support 
available when in fact there is (or is there)  and know off-hand the 
meanings of the several hundred commands, conditions, and switches in 
bash, sh, ssh,...  I should just go back to Windows?  Surely there's a 
third option somewhere!
&gt;&gt;<i> Well that is my best guess at what you were trying to say.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>Larry, what I'm saying is that I am real grateful you guys run lists 
like this.  I am busy enough at my end dealing with the technical 
language of my own line of work, trying to discern between ousia and 
hypostasis, nous and logos, form-, text-, and historical-critical 
arguments to take the few hundred hours it would take to start to get a 
short handle on the tech-speak of working out what it will take to make 
this notebook cooperate.  Either I get a smart person's help when 
needed, or I'm back to pencils and paper, and I scribble even worse than 
I type.

Thanks.

Robert
