This sounds great.  Perhaps this can be the migration vehicle for
current bcm43xx users to come to mac80211?  Especially for those with
hardware not supported by the current bcm43xx-mac80211 driver.

Are you proposing to add a third driver and deprecate the softmac
driver?  Or can we treat this as a port of the existing driver
to mac80211?  I think that might be better for users and distros,
and might let us get rid of the softmac component that much sooner.

As for the name, if we treat this as a port of the current driver to
mac80211 then perhaps we should just continue using the &quot;bcm43xx&quot; name?
If so, we need a new name for the v4-based driver -- &quot;bcm43xxtoo&quot;? :-)

Regarding hardware support, I have begun to lean towards having
the v3 driver continue to support all the hardware it does now.
I'm certainly prepared to hear the downside of that position. :-)
What exactly do we gain from using the v4 firmware?

Anyway, I'm glad to hear we are making progress on this front.
Good job, Larry!
