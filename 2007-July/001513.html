What does BS mean in this context?

Several of us try very hard to make this forum helpful, and not chew out the OP, but it is very hard 
to diagnose a problem when crucial information is missing. Suppose I asked for help in diagnosing my 
Ford truck and I didn't tell you that it is a diesel, and I didn't even say whether it started, or 
not. For the record, diagnosis of problems require the kernel version (uname -r), any patches that 
have been applied, the results from the command 'dmesg | grep bcm43xx', information about encryption 
on the access point, and any additional software being used to connect (NetworkManager, etc.). As 
stated below, if you want to use ndiswrapper, go elsewhere. We have done a lot of work to avoid that!!

&gt;<i> As for the ability to connect sometimes and not others, it is
</I>&gt;<i> something called i need to use the new kernel.  Or use rmmod bcm43xx a
</I>&gt;<i> lot.  If you are using a distros kernel, it is very likely that it

</I>&gt;<i> .  With the newer kernels, it should not be a problem. I still have
</I>&gt;<i> problems when i am to far away from my AP, but in a reasonable range,
</I>&gt;<i> it is very functional.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a uname -a would be helpful
</I>&gt;<i> lspci | grep Broadcom
