I would guess that the like is a link tx/rx indicator. There is
usually a light that tells you if the wireless is turned on.

I wonder if he got 2.6.21.4 or 2.6.22.rc7 there is a big difference.
run uname -a
that will tell us

it is a command.

&gt;<i> &gt; If you are using a distros kernel, it is very likely that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; won't work, so i direct your attention toward www.kernel.org.  At the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time that my system was exhibiting that behavior, i applied this patch

</I>&gt;<i> I will hang on to that link- thanx!
</I>
wont work on the newer kernels

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; .  With the newer kernels, it should not be a problem. I still have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems when i am to far away from my AP, but in a reasonable range,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is very functional.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a uname -a would be helpful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lspci | grep Broadcom
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dmesg | grep bcm43xx
</I>&gt;<i> What do these mean / do, by the way?
</I>
it is a | not a / it is the shift \ looks like a colon, it is known as
a pipe, and allows you to &quot;pipe&quot; the output of one command to another.
Grep is used to search the result for a string (as well as other
things).

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also that tidbit about the light was completely useless, it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware not software (the filament in your ceiling light does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effect whether or not the wall switch opens and closes)
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, but when the wifi was available again, the light started
</I>&gt;<i> flashing.  When it had quit, so had the light.  Maybe there's a hardware
</I>&gt;<i> issue I need to look into?
</I>
doubt it, suggests that it is a link light.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If wont use the bcm43xx driver you are not going to find what people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say here very useful.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, what else is there?
</I>
you said that you were using ndiswrapper you need to use that
opensource driver bcm43xx with a firmware cutter. you will need to
remove the ndiswrapper stuff, extract the firmware and load the
modules (bcm43xx-mac80211).  I believe once you have delt with
ndiswrapper (cant help you there) you need to do somthing like this:

wget <A HREF="http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/broadcom-wl-4.80.9.2.tar.bz2">http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/broadcom-wl-4.80.9.2.tar.bz2</A>
tar -xjvf broadcom-wl-4.80.9.2.tar.bz2
bcm43xx-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware/ broadcom-wl-4.80.9.2/kmod/wl_apsta.o
echo 'blacklist bcm43xx' &gt;&gt; /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist   (not positive
about this)
when you set up ndiswrapper you may have blacklisted bcm43xx-mac80211
if so you need to remove it.
modprobe bcm43xx-mac80211

I think that is all correct.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well that is my best guess at what you were trying to say.
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like you're a good guesser.  I guess!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blessings on ya!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> r.e.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
