<PRE>Today is the day I start my winter migration to a warmer clime. Until April, my full-time access to 
a broadband line is limited, which is the reason I resigned as maintainer for bcm43xx and b43legacy.

I will not be leaving the bcm43xx community completely as I have joined the reverse engineering 
group. At the moment, my involvement there has been to download the &quot;secret&quot; sources and to start 
learning the MIPS instruction set. Stefano has already asked for some help on the 802.11a section, 
and there is still the entire &quot;Draft N&quot; specification to be worked on - at least enough to get the 
BCM4328 working in 802.11g mode.

It has been a lot of fun working on the driver for the Broadcom hardware. The group has accomplished 
so much in getting a very complicated piece of hardware to function as well as it does with the 
drivers written by Broadcom. In fact, my BCM4311 has higher throughput with the b43 driver than it 
does when I'm running Windows (Yes, my machine does dual-boot, but that is mainly for testing!).
