<PRE>Hi Stefano,

That is good to hear.

I won't be able to come back as I'm &quot;tainted&quot; from looking at the decompiled Broadcom drivers.

</I>
I did most of my testing by including the following patch:

This took my 4311 with and 802.11 core revision of 0xA out of the b43 table and added it to the
b43legacy table. You can do the same with whatever is your primary card; however, I will be happy to
send the BCM4306 card. Do you have access to a PCI-based desktop running Linux? If so, I also have a
Linksys WMP11-V27, which is a B-only device that belongs to the project.

&gt;<i> Thank you for all the effort you put into this.
</I>
It has been a lot of fun, and I hope to continue contributing to the specs rather than the driver,
as we get the later Broadcom devices working.

Larry
