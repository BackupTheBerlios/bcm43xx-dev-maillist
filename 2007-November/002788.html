<PRE>&gt;<i> I had in the past managed to get bcm43xx to work with this card in Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> gutsy.  It was quite difficult to get it to connect at times, but I never
</I>&gt;<i> managed to track down whether the issue was with the driver itself or
</I>&gt;<i> network-manager.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Broadcom_BCM4318_%5bAirForce_One_54g%5d_%28Native_Driver%29">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Broadcom_BCM4318_%5bAirForce_One_54g%5d_%28Native_Driver%29</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently checked out a newer version of wireless-2.6 and checked out all
</I>&gt;<i> to compile the b43 driver.  After some messing around compiling b43-cutter
</I>&gt;<i> etc., I did get it to work.  There are still some initial connection
</I>&gt;<i> problems but I'm starting to think they are down to network-manager.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most noticeable issue with the driver is that while it connects
</I>&gt;<i> reliably but always at 2Mb/sec on 802.11G networks.  Is this expected
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gavin
</I>All, please correct me if I am getting this wrong.
Gavin,
Are you getting the speed from the NetworkManager applet, because that
only reports on the initial connection speed of the interface. To get a
current rate you must use iwconfig or another application that gets the
rate dynamically.
The code for the b43 driver starts the interface at a low rate and
constantly monitors the signal quality and adjusts the transmission power
and rate depending on the quality. In a good environment the connection
should remain reliable and the driver will steadily increase the
transmission rate.  The less reliable the connection the lower the rate. 
I consistently get 12-24 Mb/s with the driver on a stock Fedora 7/8 kernel
on a 4318.
I have had connection quality problems before, related to the channel I
was using and interference  from various other AP's in the neighbourhood.
So you might want to check this.
Thanks
Simon.
