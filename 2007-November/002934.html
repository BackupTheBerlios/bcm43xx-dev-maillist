Well, according to <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels,</A>
channel 13 would be permitted in Europe (where I live). So mac80211
will never permit this, even if it's legal to use?

I am having the same problem connecting to my wireless access point on
channel 13: iwlist scan finds the device, but any attempt to
associate, times out. I'm not sure if this would be a hardware
limitation, or rather something in the firmware or driver preventing
this. I have one machine (Apple Powermac G4), where I cannot associate
to this AP, neither with bcm43xx, neither with b43. I'm not sure if
this would be a hardware limitation, the firmware, or the Linux driver
who is responsible.

On another machine (i386 with a Broadcom based pc card), I succeed in
associating to the access point on channel 13 with bcm43xx, but it
fails with b43.

Well, even in Windows using channel 13 is confusing: with a Windows
machine having an Intel wireless chipset, with the default Windows
utility, it fails to associate, but with the wireless tools from
Intel, it succeeds...

Maybe I should try with another channel soon to verify if that's
really the reason why it does not work.
