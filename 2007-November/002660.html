Your problem is not a fault of the driver, but that of SoftMAC - the MAC layer used by bcm43xx. To
use anything but managed mode, you should switch to b43, which is included in 2.6.24-rc1. I would
suggest installing git and pulling from Linus's git tree, or using the &quot;everything&quot; branch of the
wireless-2.6 git tree. Many of us are trying to get SoftMAC removed from 2.6.25. In any case,
mac80211, which is used by b43, is a much better implementation.
