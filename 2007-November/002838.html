Exactly.

&gt;<i> _First_, mark bcm43xx as unmaintained.  Then, it's not your problem any more.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps there's someone who'd be willing to maintain it.  Otherwise, it will be
</I>&gt;<i> dropped anyway after some time - when no one uses it any more.  Still, it need
</I>&gt;<i> not be (and IMHO it shouldn't be) your decision to drop it.
</I>
Who is responsible to do that decision, if the driver authors that wrote all the
code aren't?
I'd be very happy to shift bcm43xx maintainership to someone else, but
there is _nobody_ who wants to do it. Face it. Nobody wants bcm43xx anymore.
And the only sane way to handle this is to run one release cycle with both
drivers included and remove the old driver after that.

bcm43xx is basically dropped since a year and everybody who cares knows that.
And nobody cares to maintain that piece of junk in the future.
