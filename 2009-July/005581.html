Your register accesses seem to be indirect:
	<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">root at mini</A>:&gt; inb 0x3C4 #check which register is active
	0x00
	<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">root at mini</A>:&gt; outb 0x3C4 0x2a #i want to acess register 2A
Can you explain how the register access works exactly? Is this MMIO or is this
x86 in/out instructions (PIO)?

What does lcpci -vvnn show on your system (for wifi and GPU)
