<PRE>Last time we ended with discovering it's openChrome register operation
that affects Broadcom's PCI bus. The most obvious was we have bug
causing writing over our pci region. Problem is quite well described
in <A HREF="http://www.openchrome.org/trac/ticket/288">http://www.openchrome.org/trac/ticket/288</A>

We were able to discover exact part of driver causing this problem.
It's about writing to our 0x2A register. That's well documented in one
comment: <A HREF="http://www.openchrome.org/trac/ticket/288#comment:20">http://www.openchrome.org/trac/ticket/288#comment:20</A> and
confirmed by some patches disabling 0x2A writing that are known to
workaround it.

Problem is that 0x2A doesn't seem to be anything outside our pci
region. We do many other operations on even higher ports (from 0x00 up
to 0x4C) and it doesn't seem to break anything.

Do you have any idea what can be wrong with this 0x2A? I can't imagine
any connection between GPU and WiFi done on purpose. Can that just
mean broken motherboard by design? Or maybe some BIOS issue?

As far as I know this happens only on very one notebook model, that is
HP 2133 (but many cases confirmed that, it's not just one broken
case).

I know it's not really your business, but any help/tips would be appreciated.
