<PRE>&gt;<i> Please send the output I requested!
</I>
I did not express myself correctly. The Syslog output you see is
actually the dmesg output, which has been processed via Syslog. It is
from a previous linux kernel run. It does not matter now, here is new output.

&gt;<i> One other thing. If your computer has a switch to turn the radio
</I>&gt;<i> on/off, you need to have rfkill in your configuration. It is not now.
</I>Good hint, I applied now and recompiled my kernel. Here are the results:

It is now scanning, lots of APs come up, it tries to connect to my AP
which has no security; however, it times out with no result.

Thanks for your help.
