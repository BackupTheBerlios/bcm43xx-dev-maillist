Please do not top post.

I have finished the reverse engineering for the LP-PHY devices, and
all the steps needed to program the device are supposedly in the
&quot;specs&quot; at <A HREF="http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net/802.11.">http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net/802.11.</A> There are people
that have said that they were coding parts, but I don't know what the
progress has been made. I have not seen any suggested code. What you
need to do is pick a section of the LP PHY coding, ask the community
if anyone is working on that part, and start coding if no one is
working there. The first rule is to post early and often using &quot;[RFC]
b43: LP PHY xxxxxxxxx&quot; as the subject. Your code will be reviewed and
suggestions will be forthcoming on how to improve it.

Once you get started, you will likely have questions regarding the
specs as they may be confusing or [may appear to] be inconsistent.
Post these on the mailing list as well. The clean-room rules prevent
me from writing any of the code, but I certainly can and should answer
questions about the material on the web site.
