I can assure you I know something about antenna design, gain and  
wavelength versus overall length, loading, termination, resistance,  
balancing, corona, directional versus omni-directional, resonance,  
multi-elements, arrays, yagi's, quad's and the antenna is only as  
good as the transmitter or receiver attached to it.

If the transmitter power is supplied at 70% of the available power  
then the distance that the transmitter is effective is diminished  
exponentially by the amount of power being generated.

If the receiver has the gain reduced then the S/N ratio and the  
signal level decrease logarithmically so turning it up has merit  
provided that the noise level does saturate the input signal because  
in most front-ends is some kind of circuitry that attempts to  
compress the incoming signal to prevent saturation and to continue to  
increase gain beyond this point only increases the noise level until  
it's saturation occurs and then the noise is just as loud as the signal.

First, I am not asking you to support any solution I generate for  
myself, I have not asked anyone to develop any software on my behalf,  
all I expect is that you support your software in the OS it was  
intended and this is currently where I am using it out of respect for  
you and your efforts.

Second, currently it's broken, I've offered some quick fixes to get  
the rev 2 sprom support functional again by using the same principals  
currently employed in the source.

Third, I respect your license, there is no need for you to discuss  
the terms or the inner-working of the license with me unless I have  
questions about it which I currently do not.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not BSD licensed. For good reasons, as we can see.
</I>
Your software in general is not supported by my OS, some of the  
utilities have been ported and these have been useful in achieving a  
solution in my OS but please do not mistake my coming to you with  
problems in your software as an attempt for you to code a solution  
for my OS.

If there was a fully functional easy to use solution in your OS I  
would have no problem doing my work in it, I also expect a little  
respect for my preference of OS and the environment I chose to work  
in, I do not force it upon anyone and I am not asking you to support it.
