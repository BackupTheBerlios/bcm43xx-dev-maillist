I'm sorry it's hard to take advice from a putz and so far that is the  
opinion I've reached based on my interaction with him.

Now I've pissed off everyone who can help me???

I think you are mistaken, this is not about helping me, this is about  
fixing the ssb-sprom program, something that everyone seems to have  
lost sight of or don't care about.

Re-reading his drivel doesn't sound productive.

</I>
I wasn't aware you were authoritative around here???

I also wasn't aware I needed to go anywhere, as I said, I want to  
discuss fixing the ssb-sprom program but so far those who have  
responded would rather discuss bullshit and stupidity so jump on them.

As far as ehud goes, he should have just kept his mouth shut but  
obviously, it's something he was incapable of.
