The problem with your statement is that as far as I could locate,  
this is the only tool that allows you to modify the subsystem vend/ 
prod ID's and to tweak antenna gains to improve performance of a card.

I know what I want as an end result, the lack of available software  
for my OS has had me go outside to another OS to find a solution  
which appears to be b43.ko, ssb-sprom and ssb.ko.

I can buy card-A from my OS vendor, he charges $100.00 for the card,  
BestBuy sells the same card using the same chipset but the gain is  
lower and the ID's are different and the cost if $21.00, it makes  
economical sense to purchase the $21.00 card, change the ID's and  
tweak the gain if 3 cards are required per system and the time to  
modify 3 cards is less than 15 minutes.

The advantage to modifying a card for my OS is obvious to those who  
use it, no custom drivers are required, no installation of a custom  
driver which takes roughly 5 minutes is required and additional OS  
features are activated with the use of a natively recognized card  
that are not activated using the custom driver and a card that isn't  
natively recognized.

My OS vendor isn't releasing the source for the native driver so  
making it work with generic ID'd cards is not very fruitful despite  
what people may tell you because they only understand a portion of  
the card identification process and they assume thats all there is,  
the thought that the driver is self modifying based on the subsystem  
ID's never enters their mind.

Considering it is a utility with a very unique and powerful  
capability, the ssb-sprom application itself is fairly harmless  
because it does not operate directly on a card however in my OS, I do  
not have this luxury, I have a single tool that reads the sprom data  
to disk, makes changes, saves it again with a timestamp and writes it  
back to the card in one fluid move which is a much more serious and  
potentially dangerous app in that errors of any kinds are most  
destructive so all but the ability to modify the ID's has been  
stripped until time permits me to rewrite it into a more useful set  
of tools to accomplish the task in stages.

Since my app is based on the ssb-sprom program, modification of the  
subsystem ID's has not been an issue but other changes would be  
beneficial to improving a cards performance and I'd like to take  
advantage of this option.

At this time I'm working with ssb-sprom in a standalone setting and  
working with data files rather than directly on a card so when the  
bugs have been ironed out I can redo my app with some extra safety  
features and a final prompt before writing to a card and know that  
the written data will be correct.

Since this tool has been around for quite some time I was under the  
impression that it was a solid performer which is undergoing updates  
to handle the new sprom data but seeing it needs a little massaging  
is disappointing, not discouraging, while my needs are immediate,  
quick fixes to keep me in motion are the main focus but when a little  
time permits I look into resolving something provided is doesn't eat  
too much of my time but my motivation is based on my needs and not  
the needs of the general public and this could be advantageous to  
resolving some issues if they are related to my immediate needs or  
they could not be.

I don't mind that it's broken (well I do) cause it does meet one of  
my requirements and that is ID modification and for the most part  
this is my major need, fixing the other stuff basically would allow  
me to take an alright card and turn it into a great card but as you  
already know, information is not very forthcoming from Broadcom so  
progress is slow.
