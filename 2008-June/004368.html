<PRE>Dale this is not a flame-war list or a place to show your illiteracy.  
Step off.

</I>*LOL*  Did you mean &quot;You're&quot; not very bright, because then &quot;you're&quot; 
right.  If you meant &quot;your not very bright&quot; then perhaps remedial first

</I>Perhaps instead of prescribing medications, calling people idiots and 
turds, and saying nothing of intelligence is being presented you should 
take a deep breath (go ahead, really), try not to be illiterate (you 
know, &quot;your&quot; vs &quot;you're&quot;, &quot;it's&quot; vs &quot;its&quot; and so on), and MOVE ALONG.

In case the message was unclear, let me assure you in the friendliest way,
Step off, eh.

Ehud
