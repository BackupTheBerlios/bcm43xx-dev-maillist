That was an example valse I used so I could easily see what was  
modified, making a change of +0x01 or -0x01 means you have to look  
hard to see what changes to ensure it is the correct byte, at this  
time I'm working from a file and want to be sure that whatever is  
modified in the file is correct and currently it is not.

Most cards shouldn't need to be tweaked at all while others might  
require a minor increase or decrease to improve performance, this is  
all I am after.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, as an alternative you can simply increase the antenna gain

</I>&gt;<i> You'll probably be surprised. :)
</I>&gt;<i> (However, you'll probably explain the results of the test with your
</I>&gt;<i> weird noise theories. hm...)
</I>
Weird noise theory, maybe reading a book on RF theory might help you  
to understand about noise and the S/N ratio and how the noise can  
affect superimposed modulation and frequency shifting which is the  
principal of wlan cards, wireless routers and AP's.

When you increase input sensitivity it does not just increase the  
sensitivity for the signal, it also increases sensitivity to  
everything which includes white noise.

You are implying that there is no white noise and this white noise  
does not affect the signal and that just isn't true.

The receiver portion of most lan card is PLL based with a clipping  
circuit to prevent the input signal from over saturating the the  
first stage of the receiver and causing damage, increasing input  
sensitivity beyond this level does not increase the signal past the  
clipped level but it does allow the level of the noise to reach this  
same level if sensitivity is turned up significantly.

A 1db or 2db increase in input sensitivity is probably more than  
enough to improve a cards performance if it lacks it and can  
compensate for design changes in poorly designed cards, a 10db  
increase is essentially an increase of 1000% which makes a 500mw  
signal look like a 5watt signal, this also increases the generated  
harmonics, the 3rd order harmonics being the most damaging since very  
little filtering is included in wlan cards.

We are now discussing RF fundamentals and we should be discussing the  
application which is what I originally was writing about, if you wish  
to continue a discussion about RF principals I would be more than  
happy to discuss this off list since it does not apply to fixing the  
ssb-sprom application.
