You should read a good book about antenna physics.

You will understand, that I am not going to support somebody who
takes my GPL'ed software and uses it for a proprietary in-house solution.
Of course, this is perfectly legal what you are doing, as long as
you don't redistribute the software outside of your local office.
But please do not expect any support from me unless you release your
work under the GNU/GPL version 2.
Helping you with your proprietary in-house solution would be a complete
waste of my limited time.

This is not BSD licensed. For good reasons, as we can see.
