What is your problem, maybe you should up your medication!!!

The fact that you make this response shows your not very bright, I'm  
not interested in a &quot;high&quot; and &quot;mightier than thou&quot; attitude of turds  
like you when your response doesn't contribute to anything positive.

Is everyone on this list a moron who has nothing better to do than  
attack another list member who is trying to instigate advancement and  
corrections or are there some who can contribute in a positive way  
without attacking another???

No need to respond to that, I don't believe everyone on this list is  
an idiot.

No need for you to respond at all, I'll wait for someone intelligent  
to offer something of value while anyone else who doesn't have  
anything positive to add to this thread and does will only be  
demonstrating their lack of intelligence.

At this time yes, if you respond to this thread with anything that  
does not contribute to fixing the ssb-sprom program you will be seen  
as an idiot and an instigator.
