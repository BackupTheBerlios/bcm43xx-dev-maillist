At the moment, b43 does not support the LP-PHY, which we think is a low-power 
b/g device. The RE team is working hard on the routines found in driver 
4.150.10.5, which supports LP and N-PHYs. Until we finish the decompiling, 
write the specs, the coders create the necessary modifications to b43, AND 
the specs and code are debugged, your device will not work. You can either 
use ndiswrapper, or pick up one of the low-cost Dell versions of the DW1390 
from E-bay, which is a BCM4311, or a DW1490, which is a BCM4312. With your HP 
laptop, you will need to change the vendor and product ID's to match your 
current card using ssb-sprom. HP white-lists PCIe cards and will not boot is 
an incorrect one is installed.

Booting the machine so that the SPROM can be changed is a little tricky. You 
need to remove the WLAN card, boot into GRUB, and press a key to stop the 
automatic GRUB booting. Next you install the WLAN card with the power on, and 
then finish booting. I don't mess around with the antenna leads at this 
point. You then need to extract the current SPROM contents, rewrite then 
Subsytem product ID to 0x137C, rewrite the Subsystem vendor ID to 0x103C, and 
rewrite the SPROM contents. These steps are described in the README in the 
ssb-sprom directory. At this point, reboot the machine and if it comes up 
correctly, you can finish buttoning up the installation.


My laptop also came with the BCM4310 - that card is on the shelf while I use 
a DW1490, which I bought for $17 (including shipping) on E-bay. On ebay.it, 
there are two for sale for 5-6 EUR, plus shipping. I also have a BCM4311/2.
