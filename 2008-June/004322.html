<PRE>Quoting <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">gavron at wetwork.net</A>:

&gt;<i> Normal kernel, step 1 is the same.
</I>&gt;<i> Normal kernel, step 2 is make &amp;&amp; make modules_install
</I>&gt;<i> Normal kernel, step 3 is make install
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For step 2 on a non Debian machine I can add -j3 and run three
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneous processes.  I can build an entire kernel tree from scratch
</I>&gt;<i> in under 20 minutes.  The make-kpkg takes 47 minutes.
</I>
Let's not waste time on this.  Debian won't improve the driver for us.  
  Adding user friendly instructions (let alone distributing custom  
kernels) will likely increase the number of questions, no matter how  
good and friendly the instructions may be.  The end result will be b43  
developers supporting people who cannot contribute anything useful to  
the driver, who cannot describe their configuration, who don't read  
instructions and who disappear as soon as their problem is solved.   
Distros should be doing this, not us.  They are better equipped to  
deal with it.

This is evidenced by my experience with MadWifi, where providing a  
user friendly snapshot with support for the latest hardware resulted  
in turning one on the Trac tickets into a trollfest with occasional  
name calling and suggestions to run &quot;rm -rf /&quot; to install the driver.   
That mess required administrative permissions to clean up and took  
some time that could have been spent on fixing real bugs.

Let's publish the instructions that are already written, and that's it.
