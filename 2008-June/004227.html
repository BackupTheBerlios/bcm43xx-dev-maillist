<PRE>Well, I have a different card to modify as I prepare to familiarize  
myself with the process so that when the bcm4321 chipset (0x4328 /  
0x4329) is supported I will have great success.

I found a miniPCI card from a china made bcm4306 based card with the  
0x4320 ID that was not recognized as an Apple Airport card.

It look like it would be recognized by the b43 module based on source  
examination so I figured I'd use a PCI to miniPCI adapter and see if  
I can make the changes without bricking the card.

iwpriv doesn't seem to like the b43 module recognized card and  
wouldn't allow me to perform any read/write functions and it was  
hinted that this method is for the older bcm43xx module.

I located the ssb_sprom file for the card in question by  
identification of &quot;lspci&quot; and copied out the ssb_sprom file to the  
Desktop as &quot;original_sprom&quot; for easy identification (and so I know  
which was the unmodified).

Time for step one:
I modified the firmware with the ID's I want using the &quot;ssb-sprom&quot;  
application.

On to step two:
As suggested by Asheesh, I copied the modified firmware file onto the  
ssb_sprom file in the original location and at first I couldn't tell  
and wasn't sure if anything happened so I &quot;rmmod b43; modprobe b43&quot;  
and copied the ssb_sprom file back to the desktop as  
&quot;new_original_sprom&quot; and then did &quot;ssb-sprom -i Desktop/ 
new_original_sprom -P&quot; and my new ID's were displayed so it was time  
to test this so I started trying the card in various computers and  
was elated with the success of things.

Results now in Mac OS X on a B&amp;W G3, a PowerPC Dual G5 Xserve and an  
generic Intel x86 PC sporting a Core 2 Quad is that the card is  
natively recognized and supported.

Now I have question regarding the process I performed.

Was the disabling and enabling of &quot;b43 required&quot;???

Is this the correct procedure for modification of the subsys ID's???
