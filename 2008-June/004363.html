Yes.

That is because the FCC (and most regulatory agencies) is paranoid about just 
anybody turning these things up to illegal output values, so it is they who 
have put the shroud of secrecy about this stuff, which many of them can do 
since the chipsets are not US specific, but largely universal as other places 
allow more power output and somewhat different band usage limits &amp; channel 
assignments.  The fact that this suits Broadcoms business model is just icing 
on the cake for their legal staff.

&gt;<i>In my dealings with Broadcom, I'm told that receiver gain and

</I>&gt;<i>information so I have to go by the information I can find which is

Possibly, provided your sidewalk superintending is just that.  As a broadcast 
engineer with nearly 60 years of steering electrons in ways to make them do 
useful work, I think Michael has a better understanding of what it is that he 
is slowly discovering and making work than someone who just walked in the door.  
Even with my experience, I wouldn't pretend to think I can tell Micheal or 
Larry what to do, so why should you be capable of doing that with maybe a month 
of observation?
