You must be a moron to continue to pursue this conversation.

No, only you are a moron as far as I can tell.

</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps instead of prescribing medications, calling people idiots  
</I>&gt;<i> and turds, and saying nothing of intelligence is being presented  
</I>&gt;<i> you should take a deep breath (go ahead, really), try not to be

</I>&gt;<i> on), and MOVE ALONG.

Now it's an issue of literacy???

What a putz you are, looking for something, anything to make you feel  
better than everyone else by giving you something to complain about,  
I could care less if it's &quot;your&quot; or &quot;you're&quot; as long as you shut up,  
get a life dude.

&gt;<i> In case the message was unclear, let me assure you in the  
</I>&gt;<i> friendliest way,
</I>&gt;<i> Step off, eh.
</I>
What is your problem???

Don't you have any more intelligence than what you have displayed???

Why don't you step off.

If you had kept your mouth shut in the first place then this  
conversation wouldn't be happening, you really need to get laid!!!!
