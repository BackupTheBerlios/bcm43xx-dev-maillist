I know that I need to change the ID's on the card for the driver to  
work properly, it's source is not available so I NEED to make these  
changes.

Pointing me to google didn't help, I've been that route with little  
success, like I said, my search skills suck and after 2 days of  
searching this is the closets I've come to anything remotely related  
to what I need.

Knowledge of the environment is how I concluded this.

</I>&gt;<i> Ehud
</I>
If they're intelligent they wont penalize me for my preference of OS,  
they may poke a little fun but I highly doubt it will turn into  
anything vicious.

Well, based on a windows utility I borrowed some routines and wrote a  
Mac utility to extract the info from the PCI card to better examine  
and clarify what I need to change.

This is the returned data:

vendorid: 0x14e4
deviceid: 0x4329
radiorev: 0x42055000
chipnum: 0x4321
chiprev: 0x1
corerev: 0xb
boardid: 0x60
boardvendor: 0x1737
boardrev: 0x48
driverrev: 0x4aa2e05


The three values I wish to change are deviceid, boardid and  
boardvendor although I believe that I could get away with just  
boardid and boardvendor (guessing).



While I'm waiting for some assistance I managed to find and build  
some of the bcm43xx utilities (hoping they are the required versions)  
I hope will help me work this out, I built them in such a manner that  
the utilities can be used on any Mac regardless of architecture (PPC/ 
X86) so now I believe I'm a little closer to my goal.

localhost:~ admin$ bcm43xx-sprom -v
BCM43xx SPROM data modification tool version 001
localhost:~ admin$ bcm43xx-ival -v
BCM43xx InitVal file tool version 001
localhost:~  admin$ bcm43xx-fwcutter -v
bcm43xx-fwcutter version 004
localhost:~  admin$

My limited understanding of the bcm43xx-XXXXX utilities is that they  
require the firmware to be in a binary file and that it does not  
directly operate on the card so I think now I just need to find a way  
to get the sprom to disk.

If the version I built are too old (what I could find) or newer  
versions are recommended if you could supply a tarball of the sources  
I'd appreciate it.

If I understand the sprom utility help, --subp, --subv and --ppid  
will change the three values I'm looking to change and will also  
adjust the checksum based on the changes so it looks like I just need  
to get the firmware out of the card and into a file the utilities can  
modify it.

Since I suspect I'm going to need some kind of linux I have since  
dedicated an Intel D975XBX2KR with a Q6600 and a 500gb HDA so if I  
need to go the route of installing something like Mandriva (I have a  
CD with it) but have never installed or used it so fluency is non- 
existent.

I have no clue what (if any) developer tools will come with the  
Mandriva installation but I'm hoping that I wont have to go that route.

For the fwcutter utility I did adjust the FIRMWARE_INSTALL_DIR to &quot;/ 
wireless/firmware&quot; as a repository.

As a motivational factor, I have two new mini-PCIe Apple (Broadcom)  
802.11n wireless card that have the correct values, they're based on  
the same chipset as the PCI card, tried one in a Sony VAIO laptop  
running (dual booting) windows XP and Mac OS X 10.5.x in a vanilla  
installation (unmodified apple software, just a couple of additional  
extensions/drivers to make it all work) and was able to obtain the  
ID's I need, I would be more than happy to donate the unopened card  
in exchange for helping solve my ID problem.
