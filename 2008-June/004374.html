I'm sorry, we cannot reproduce this bug.
I'm also unsure how hwcrypto could break here. The driver/firmware doesn't
even know about whether there's a monitor interface in addition to the
STA interface. The firmware simply decrypts the packet or it doesn't.
If the firmware does decrypt, the driver will clear the protected bit.
If it doesn't decrypt, the driver won't clear the bit.

I guess you need to debug this by yourself, if you can still reproduce
the bug. see drivers/net/b43/xmit.c for the b43_rx function. You can add
a few sanity checks there. If you don't find a bug here, go up to the
mac80211 stack.
