</I>That is not a fact.  That's an unproven assertion.
&gt;<i> As a result,

</I>Whatever subjective phrase &quot;support...is...just superb&quot; there's no such 
causality.  That means, to use smaller words, that there's no indication 
that the &quot;superb support&quot; is BECAUSE they released open-source drivers.  
I'm sure that is a factor, but it's not a CAUSE.
&gt;<i> If you want a card that will work
