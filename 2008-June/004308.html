aye, will do.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
this is a fact as opposed to an assertion, at least in general.  When
the OEM releases information about how a specific piece of hardware
works, that information will be more accurate than clean-room
reverse-engineered specifications in almost every situation.  It may
just be a subtle difference, but that may make or break the
performance.  YMMV.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As a result,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support for their chips in Linux is just superb;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever subjective phrase &quot;support...is...just superb&quot; there's no such
</I>&gt;<i> causality.  That means, to use smaller words, that there's no indication
</I>&gt;<i> that the &quot;superb support&quot; is BECAUSE they released open-source drivers.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure that is a factor, but it's not a CAUSE.
</I>
Again I'd disagree.  The good folks over at rt2x00.serialmonkey.com
have spent a vast amount of time cleaning up the Ralink drivers for
inclusion in the vanilla kernel.  Without the vendor support it is
almost certain that there would be no F/OSS driver available for this
hardware.  Thus the excellent open-source hardware support for their
cards is a direct result (aka a &quot;cause&quot;) of their source code
releases.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you want a card that will work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perfectly in all situations, go with a card that has a Ralink chipset.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I wanted a commercial or spam I'd join another list.
</I>
I don't view my comments as commercials or spam.  Notice that I
carefully avoided mentioning any specific manufacturer or device by
name.  Ralink only produces the chipsets; the consumer cards that
contains these chips are manufactured by e.g. Hawking Technologies.
Nowhere in my original mail did I mention a device vendor by name.

P.S. MB -- thanks for your support :)
