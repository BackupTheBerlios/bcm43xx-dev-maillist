I presume we're talking about using Darwin on Intel chips, not Darwin on 
those old-school PowerPC chips of yore. (-;

Note that it would be very easy for *you* to become that &quot;user with Linux 
on his Apple hardware&quot; - just download (for example) the Ubuntu 8.04 CD 
image, burn it to a disc, and boot from it (hold down &quot;c&quot;, if memory 
serves...).

Then you can run whatever Linux tools you need.  If you need further help, 
try to find me (I use the nickname paulproteus, and I hang out on 
#freeculture and #jhuacm on the &quot;Ubuntu Servers&quot; (FreeNode) IRC network) 
on IRC and I can probably help some more.  But Larry's advice may be 
enough for you.

If the Ubuntu disc can get you online (note that you should probably try 
to connect to your network via a wired network while you fiddle with your 
wireless, then you can launch the bundled IRC client, join the &quot;Ubuntu 
Servers&quot; network, and then type &quot;/join #jhuacm&quot; to find me.
