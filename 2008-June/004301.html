</I>Funny you should mention that.  I spent two hours last night trying to 
get a BCM4306 working under Deb 2.6.24.4 with no success.   I've had no 
problems getting the same card to work under Fedora from 2.6.23 all the 
way through 2.6.26-rc6.

You didn't mention which kernel you have (uname -a), but as the previous 
sentence will help confound the issue, there's something about the 
Debian distro that makes it not work [more on what &quot;not work&quot; below] and 
I haven't isolated what it is as of yet.

1. The firmware loads.     sudo dmesg | grep b43    shows that the chip 
is detected, the LEDs are connected, etc. 
2. The interface shows up.   sudo iwconfig     shows  wlan0
3. The interface turns on.    sudo ifconfig wlan0 up     no errors
NOT WORK:
4. Unable to scan for networks.  sudo   iwlist wlan0 scan      
5. Unable to associate with AP.    sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid ehudssid 
key wepkeygoeshere open   shows link quality 0 and no AP

I'm currently hunting for more clues.
