Sorta, if the device does not contain their ID's then enhanced  
features and functionality are disabled or not enabled.

The card is recognized as a third-party Airport Extreme card  
supporting a/b/g/n but the driver due to the lack of apple ID's does  
not enable 11n functionality so the best connection speed is 54g.

Unfortunately the driver source for Mac OS X is not available  
otherwise I'd just change it to recognize my ID's.

</I>&gt;<i> likely wouldn't be worth the effort.).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> The sprom updating facility described above utilizes the /sys

</I>&gt;<i> flash device. The codes could also be changed by a Linux user with  
</I>&gt;<i> x86 (PC) hardware as long as the card will fit in their computer.
</I>
If I could find the ssb-sprom source I might be able to generate a  
version that works on a Mac, I do have a little skill.

I also have x86 computer hardware that can run linux I believe,  
unless linux doesn't support 500gb HDA's, ATI X1300 video cards, ICH7  
or Core 2 Quad CPU's?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have no problems using a CLI utility and navigation is not an  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hopefully someone can provide a link for a windows utility that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fits my needs or a GNU source package that can be built on the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> majority of *nix based OSes that doesn't have many obscure  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> external dependancies (I have been know to compile things that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't normally compile on my OS).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As explained above, this cannot happen.
</I>
I'll refrain from responding to this comment because I am not  
entirely convinced this is factual at this time.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, to get the laughing over with I'll mention my OS, Darwin, yes  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you heard it correctly, 5 different versions of it, Darwin7,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Darwin8, Darwin9, Mac OS X 10.4.x and Mac OS X 10.5.x, Mac OS X is
