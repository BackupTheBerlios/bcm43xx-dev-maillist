I don't want to increase it to an illegal level or blindly make  
changes with throughly testing the effects of the changes to ensure  
they are optimum settings and still within legal levels.

</I>
Sidewalk superintending???

What you do has nothing to do with fixing the program and I could  
really care less about what you do, as I have been saying, it's  
broken so lets fix it.

I'm not telling him to do anything, when the program works properly I  
will conduct tests and draw conclusions based on the results, make  
the results available to others but I certainly wont do it with a  
broken program.

At this time there is no certainty that he has decoded the data  
properly because there is no manufacturing documentation I can find  
that outlines the data, only a very good possibility that he has  
decoded it properly and this is what I am counting on.

Regardless of anything I want to do to a card, the program needs to  
be fixed and the focus is being sidetracked by chatter of licenses  
and books about antennas which have nothing to do with the ssb-sprom  
program working.

Discussing anything with me other than fixing the program is a  
complete waste of time yet people are hell-bent on sidetracking the  
fixing of the program, draw whatever conclusion you want from it,  
unless you have something of value to add towards fixing the program  
your comments have no value.

We can sit here in a pissing contest and the ruffling of feathers  
about bullshit and stupidity for months to come and it wont change  
the fact that the application is broken and needs to be fixed, if you  
don't wish to contribute to fixing it then I suggest you let someone  
who does intervene and let the focus return to fixing the program.
