<PRE>I'm new to the list and new to firmware modification so hi everyone.

I have a broadcom PCI card and I need to modify the vendor and  
product ID's, in case it matters it's a LinkSYS WMP300N.

I've looked around for tools and came across something that looked  
promising but it gave a URL of &quot;git clone <A HREF="http://git.bu3sch.de/git/">http://git.bu3sch.de/git/</A> 
b43-tools.git&quot; and I have no clue what git is or how to use it and  
cursory searches imply some kind of linux tool.

I have a semi linux environment available that allows me to  
&quot;configure/make&quot; software so gnu related software can be built but  
rpm and git and the likes don't apply to the OS so suggesting them  
wouldn't be helpful since I can't use them.

Since my everday OS isn't widely supported, I was hoping there was a  
windows app that would read the sprom allow me to change the ID's and  
write it back out to the card but I couldn't find anything (my search  
skills suck).

I have no problems using a CLI utility and navigation is not an issue.

Hopefully someone can provide a link for a windows utility that fits  
my needs or a GNU source package that can be built on the majority of  
*nix based OSes that doesn't have many obscure external dependancies  
(I have been know to compile things that don't normally compile on my  
OS).

So, to get the laughing over with I'll mention my OS, Darwin, yes you  
heard it correctly, 5 different versions of it, Darwin7, Darwin8,  
Darwin9, Mac OS X 10.4.x and Mac OS X 10.5.x, Mac OS X is Darwin  
based so this explains why rpm's and git won't work for me.
