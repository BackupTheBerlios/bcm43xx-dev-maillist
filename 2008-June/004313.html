<PRE>Hi Larry,

just as I am using openSuSE 11.0 with two b43-cards, I drop some 
comments to your questions below.

Larry Finger schrieb:
&gt;<i> OpenSUSE 11.0 was recently released with a 2.6.25 kernel. The default 
</I>&gt;<i> drivers for Broadcom wireless devices switched from bcm43xx to b43 and 
</I>&gt;<i> b43legacy, which meant that nearly every user had to reinstall their 
</I>&gt;<i> firmware, even if they upgraded from 10.3. The distribution includes a 
</I>&gt;<i> compiled copy of b43-fwcutter, and a script to download the Broadcom 
</I>&gt;<i> driver files, extract the firmware, and install it; however, the 
</I>&gt;<i> presence of this script is not well publicized. Many of those with 
</I>&gt;<i> problems had found the b43 page at linux-wireless, but still had 
</I>&gt;<i> problems for the usual reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To help with the problems, I am considering adding a new section to 
</I>&gt;<i> the b43 web page describing such distro aids for firmware 
</I>&gt;<i> installation, which brings 2 questions to mind:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Is this a good idea?
</I>
Well, yes. I think so. As I am an experienced user I just had a look at 
the b43-page just before installing openSuSE 11.0 and burned the 
firmware to CD, so I could do my network installation :)

So, what should be mentioned is something like: Download Firmware x for 
Distro y and run fwcutter. As the rest is already on the page :)

&gt;<i> (2) If so, what other distros offer similar aids/tools?
</I>
Unfortunately I don't know by self-experience, but as far as I know 
Ubuntu is at least discussing something like that:
