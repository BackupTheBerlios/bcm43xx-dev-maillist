A BCM4306 rev 03 is used my Michael Buesch, the main developer of b43, 
and I think he uses it on PPC hardware. If not, he will let us know.

The correct driver to use is b43. If you had a rev 2 BCM4306, it would 
use b43legacy. The choice of b43 versus b43legacy is made by ssb and 
is dependent on the revision level of the 802.11 core located on the 
Sonics Silicon Backplane. That rev level cannot be seen from the 
outside. I repeat - b43 is the correct driver.

Your initial choice of firmware was correct. It should be extracted 
from the 4.150.10.5 driver. One should _NEVER_ link /lib/firmware/b43 
to /lib/firmware/b43legacy. After you did that, you tried to load V3 
firmware, which does not work with b43, thus the &quot;TOO OLD&quot; message.

As to why your system locked up, I don't know. To help debug this, use 
a 'sudo strace ifup' command to start bringing up the interface. This 
produces a lot of output, but hopefully it will reveal something 
useful on the screen when it freezes. To get the most output, maximize 
the terminal in which you issue the command.

This sounds like a problem in the PPC port of F9. I hope you have 
looked at the Fedora forums.
