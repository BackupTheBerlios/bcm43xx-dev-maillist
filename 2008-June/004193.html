That's great news!  Having distributable firmware would simplify
installation, placing b43 to the same league as Intel devices.  But
having free firmware would be unique to Broadcom card and extremely
attractive for research in wireless communications and development of
novel devices using non-standard protocol extensions.

As a short term goal, maybe bcm4328 could be dumbed down to work with
b43?

I've tried it with bcm4318 first, and it hung hard on module load.  Even
Alt-SysRq would not work.  It turns out it was revision 9 missing in
your list.

Then I tries a bcm4306 device with rev 5 core.  The module loaded.  I
brought it up in managed mode first.  Scanning didn't work.  I brought
the device down and set monitor mode.  But the system hung when I tried
to bring the interface back up.

Anyway, I'm glad to see progress in that direction.
