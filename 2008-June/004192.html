The problem with dhclient is that it brings the interface down
temporarily, thus breaking the WPA connection.  You can see hostap
archives for a recent discussion about it:
<A HREF="http://lists.shmoo.com/pipermail/hostap/">http://lists.shmoo.com/pipermail/hostap/</A>

It's a complicated problem, involving a lot of software, including
distribution specific scripts.  It's entirely possible that simply
different timing can break the behavior.  Jouni Malinen mentioned that
the driver is supposed to tell wpa_supplicant to renegotiate the
connection after the interface goes down and up.  It's possible that the
kernel is not doing it right, but the code is not in b43legacy, it's in
mac80211.

My solution is either to use static addresses with WPA or use a dhclient
script that brings the interface up and tell wpa_supplicant to
renegotiate the connection.

In any case, I'm quite sure that discussing the problem here is not
going to be useful because it's not specific to the particular driver.
