Does Apple white- (or black-) list PCI devices the same as HP does?

git is the version-control system developed by Linus Torvalds and used to 
handle the Linux source and other projects within Linux. It could probably be 
built for Unix (i.e. the base OS for Mac, but it likely wouldn't be worth the 
effort.).

&gt;<i> I have a semi linux environment available that allows me to

</I>&gt;<i> and git and the likes don't apply to the OS so suggesting them wouldn't

</I>
The sprom updating facility described above utilizes the /sys pseudo-file 
system of Linux and will never work on any other OS. Your only hope would be 
to find a user with Linux on his Apple hardware and build the ssb-sprom 
utility. If you were to place the resulting executable on a flash drive, you 
could boot the appropriate version of a live CD, then execute ssb-sprom from 
the flash device. The codes could also be changed by a Linux user with x86 
(PC) hardware as long as the card will fit in their computer.

&gt;<i> I have no problems using a CLI utility and navigation is not an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully someone can provide a link for a windows utility that fits my

</I>&gt;<i> based OSes that doesn't have many obscure external dependancies (I have 
</I>&gt;<i> been know to compile things that don't normally compile on my OS).
</I>
As explained above, this cannot happen.

&gt;<i> So, to get the laughing over with I'll mention my OS, Darwin, yes you
