<PRE>Hello,

I recently installed Fedora 9 PPC on a Powerbook G4 Titanium.  I have
been trying to configure the Airport Extreme wireless card without
success.  The b43 loads, and the interface is available, but after
installing the firmware, the system freezes and requires a hard reboot.

At first, I thought I should use b43 and new firmware, since this is
kernel 2.6.25 (and Fedora wanted to use that driver!).  Although,
perhaps I should use b43legacy and old firmware, since this is a
&quot;BCM4306 ... rev(03)&quot; card.

Has anyone got this card working?

Below is the entire procedure I went through already, trying both
drivers and firmware; sorry for the long post. :)

Regards,
Richard

Reading the supported devices list on the b43 website, this is an
Airport Extreme Mini-PCI Card, and should work.

Fedora automagically wanted to use the b43 driver.  F9 ships:

I followed the instructions on the b43 website to use b43-fwcutter to
extract the firmware.  b43-fwcutter version 011 ships with Fedora:

# b43-fwcutter --version
b43-fwcutter version 011

Initially, I used the b43-new instructions because I (Fedora) was using
the b43 driver from 2.6.25.  I verified the MD5SUM of the firmware file
matched an acceptable one from &quot;b43-fwcutter --list&quot;:

b43             wl_apsta_mimo.o         410.2160        FW13 cb8d70972b885b1f8883b943c0261a3c

After installing the firmware into /lib/firmware/b43, I &quot;modprobe
-r&quot;/&quot;modprobe&quot; cycled the b43 driver.  During &quot;ifup wlan0&quot; (I believe
it's when dhclient starts), the system simply freezes; a total lockup,
holding down the power button to force a shutdown was necessary.  I
rebooted to try again, but the same problem occurred.

Based on &quot;lspci -v -v&quot; telling me I had a &quot;BCM4306 ... (rev 03)&quot;
Broadcom card, and this from the website:

&gt;<i> b43legacy should be used on all 4301 and 4303 cards. 4306 and 4309
</I>&gt;<i> cards with a MAC core revision of 4 or less should also use b43legacy.
</I>&gt;<i> b43 should be used on all other cards. You can safely have both
</I>&gt;<i> versions built on the same system. The full MAC core version is
</I>&gt;<i> printed in the kernel logs when &quot;SSB debugging&quot; is enabled in KConfig
</I>&gt;<i> and the driver finds a board.
</I>
I decided perhaps I was supposed to use the b43legacy driver and
therefore also a different firmware.

I then followed the firmware extraction and installation for the older
firmware.  I again verified the firmware matched &quot;b43-fwcutter --list&quot;,
and b43-fwcutter installed the firmware into /lib/firmware/b43legacy.  

b43legacy       wl_apsta.o              295.14          FW10 e08665c5c5b66beb9c3b2dd54aa80cb3

# b43-fwcutter -i wl_apsta-3.130.20.0.o 
This file is recognised as:
  ID         :  FW10
  filename   :  wl_apsta.o
  version    :  295.14
  MD5        :  e08665c5c5b66beb9c3b2dd54aa80cb3


I insured there were no b43 modules inserted (&quot;lsmod | grep 43&quot;), then
modprobed b43legacy.  Strangely, Fedora also loaded the b43 driver.
dmesg showed me the driver couldn't find the ucode5.fw file, it wasn't
looking in /lib/firmware/b43legacy, it was looking in /lib/firmware/b43.
So, I linked /lib/firmware/b43 -&gt; /lib/firmware/b43legacy.  Then it told
me the firmware was too old.

Figuring b43 was still involved somehow, but it shouldn't be, I
blacklisted b43.  Now, after &quot;modprobe b43legacy&quot; there is no wlan0
interface, so I cannot &quot;ifup wlan0&quot;.  In syslog I find:

Jun 29 16:46:57 localhost kernel: ssb: Sonics Silicon Backplane found on PCI device 0001:10:12.0
Jun 29 16:46:57 localhost kernel: Broadcom 43xx-legacy driver loaded [ Features: PLRID, Firmware-ID: FW10 ]


While &quot;modprobe b43&quot; now yields:
(with /lib/firmware/b43 -&gt; /lib/firmware/b43legacy)

Jun 29 16:44:21 localhost kernel: ssb: Sonics Silicon Backplane found on PCI device 0001:10:12.0

Jun 29 16:44:21 localhost kernel: Broadcom 43xx driver loaded [ Features: PMLR, Firmware-ID: FW13 ]

but, &quot;ifup wlan0&quot; yields:

Jun 29 16:44:57 localhost kernel: b43-phy0 ERROR: YOUR FIRMWARE IS TOO OLD.
