That card will work with openSUSE 11.0. Grab the Live CD from their 
web site, boot it and select the Install option after it is booted. 
You will need your wired ethernet until it finishes installing and 
updating. The last step after the installation is complete is to open 
a console and enter the command

sudo /usr/sbin/install_bcm43xx_firmware

Despite the name of the script, it will download and install firmware 
for b43 and b43legacy.

I have been using BCM4306 and BCM4318 PCMCIA cards for years. My 
BCM4306 is a rev 2, which uses b43legacy, but Michael Buesch has a rev 
3 that he uses for development.

As Ehud stated, there is something strange about Debian systems. I'm 
currently trying to help Ubuntu 8.04 users get their devices working.
