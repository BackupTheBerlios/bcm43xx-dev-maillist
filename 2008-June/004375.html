Hmm... I re-checked, and now it appears that the packets are now
passed with the protected bit set correctly, but still they arrive
decrypted. Trying to transmit an already-encrypted frame results in it
being double-encrypted. However, I believe that a raw monitor mode
interface should pass the packets as they are received. and not in
decrypted form.
