Oh, I just realize that these patches received via vger.kernel.org list are just fine.
It's just berlios' mailman which mangles the mails for me. Which is not surprising,
because berlios is a really really broken platform and its mailservers are even worse than that.

So I guess everything is fine now.

So while we are at it, I'd really like to migrate away from the berlios list.
It's really just annoying. Does somebody have a good reliable mailinglist service
we could migrate to? Does vger offer lists to driver projects?
