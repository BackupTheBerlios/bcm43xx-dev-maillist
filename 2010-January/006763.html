<PRE>Interesting!

Do you have wpa_supplicant running also when not using encryption?

I also get this issue, but with ath9k.

I have made some noise on the ath9k list about it, and currently have
a reboot pending to try the latest wireless-testing, which has gotten
some more fixes.


&gt;<i> When it happens:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It happens only in case not using encryption. An other laptop with

</I>
I upgraded from ipw2200 to ath9k in my laptop and the old card never
had trouble. Both ath9k and b43 use mac80211 but ipw2200 does not.
With mac80211 you're apparently supposed to always have wpa_supplicant
running - even if not using encryption. The supplicant is responsible
for reconnecting if the interface is disconnected for any reason.

I'm not satisfied with this as the final answer yet. I find it
suspicious that my card disconnects in the first place.

I am normally in a moderately silent RF environment, with not many
APs. With power management enabled (iwconfig eth1 power on) I
experience this issue within minutes. With PM disabled, it happens
only every couple of days. This is on wireless-testing as of Dec 14.
In a very tough RF environment such as a hacker conference the
problem is much more pronounced and disconnects happen many times per
day also with PM off.


&gt;<i> Any ideas?
</I>
Does iwconfig power off make a difference for you?
