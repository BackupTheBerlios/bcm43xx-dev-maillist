Nope.

</I>
Please let me know if that helped (which git repo, which branch?).

&gt;<i> I upgraded from ipw2200 to ath9k in my laptop and the old card never

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not satisfied with this as the final answer yet. I find it
</I>&gt;<i> suspicious that my card disconnects in the first place.
</I>
That does not seem to help here:

# wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -Dwext -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
# iwconfig eth0 essid linksys
# iwconfig
lo        no wireless extensions.

eth1      no wireless extensions.

eth0      IEEE 802.11bg  Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated
          Tx-Power=27 dBm
          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:off

Note that this is different from what I got when wpa_supplicant was not
running. The output after ~5sec was:

# iwconfig
lo        no wireless extensions.

eth1      no wireless extensions.

eth0      IEEE 802.11bg  ESSID:&quot;linksys&quot;
          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=27 dBm
          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:off

What should the wpa_supplicant config include? Currently my config has
nothing about the unencrypted access point. It's like:

# cat /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

network={
        ssid=&quot;ap_with_wpa&quot;
        psk=&quot;secret&quot;
}

Should I include a section for the &quot;linksys&quot; (which has no encryption)
AP as well? if yes, what should it look like? The same as the above,
just without the psk line?

&gt;<i> I am normally in a moderately silent RF environment, with not many
</I>&gt;<i> APs. With power management enabled (iwconfig eth1 power on) I
</I>&gt;<i> experience this issue within minutes. With PM disabled, it happens
</I>&gt;<i> only every couple of days. This is on wireless-testing as of Dec 14.
</I>&gt;<i> In a very tough RF environment such as a hacker conference the
</I>&gt;<i> problem is much more pronounced and disconnects happen many times per
</I>&gt;<i> day also with PM off.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any ideas?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does iwconfig power off make a difference for you?
</I>
It seems to be already off, but when I run the command:

# iwconfig eth0 power off
Error for wireless request &quot;Set Power Management&quot; (8B2C) :
    SET failed on device eth0 ; Operation not supported.

Please keep me in CC, I'm not subscribed. (Actually I am, but mail
delivery is disabled.)

Thanks!

PS: I sent this mail twice, look like the first got lost because I
forgot to replace the public.gmane.org addresses in the mail. If this is
not the case, sorry for the dupe.
