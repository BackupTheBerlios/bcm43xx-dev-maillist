<PRE>Hi all,

I'm running a newer Compaq laptop (v3000 series) which has one of these
wonderful broadcom PCI-E 4311 chips in them.  I've been testing the
devicescape bcm43xx  drivers from the wireless-dev tree for awhile, but I
still haven't gotten anything to work.  This is the first time I've
submitted to a development list proper, so I apologize in advance if I've
forgotten anything or done something incorrectly.

Output from lspci -vv:

Even though lspci identifies this as a BCM4310 (UART), I've been told that
this is actually a 4311 core.

I compiled a 2.6.19.1 kernel to test out the new PCI-E patches this
afternoon, and while it compiled cleanly and was able to scan, I was unable
to associate with any access points, encrypted or otherwise.  The relevant
parts of dmesg are:

[  141.200000] bcm43xx: Radio turned off

I turned the radio off myself when it failed to authenticate.  I repeated
the process, (rmmod bcm43xx, modprobe 43xx, and then attempt to connect)
but got  an identical result.

Oh, and there's one other thing that I'd like to bring to the attention of
this list.  The bcm43xx driver supplied with the default Ubuntu Edgy kernel
works.  It runs very, very slowly (about 20 KB/s for download and even
slower for upload) but it identifies my chip and authenticates- the whole 9
yards.  Just a heads up.

If anyone needs any other information about my setup or from the logs,
please ask.  Thanks for all the hard work everyone is doing on this driver!
