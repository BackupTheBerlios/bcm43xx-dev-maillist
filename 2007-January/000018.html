On the other hand, their reason is to try to make more money off
hardware before others learn how it works.  All useful technology that
is around long enough gets cheaper, and all who restrict such
intellectual property will find less and less demand for it.  That
isn't to say I wouldn't try to make money too; they must know this to
be that concerned with getting as much as they can from it before it's
completely commonplace/obsolete.
But in a way I think you're right.  If I had known about this
situation before buying I wouldn't have gotten Broadcom, but if I had
known about the situation and it had already been resolved by Linux
developers, I still would have gotten Broadcom.  On the OTHER hand,
what's to stop them from just coming out with more models that aren't
yet supported?
