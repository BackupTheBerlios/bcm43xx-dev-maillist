<PRE>Hi,
I have very strange problem. Maybe it's because I'm running 2.6.18 kernel, but I think I saw somebody connected and worked with this version.

I have a bcm4311 card (Dell 1390 mini-PCI).

0b:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation Unknown device 4311 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Dell Unknown device 0007
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 16
        Memory at dfdfc000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 2
        Capabilities: [58] Message Signalled Interrupts: 64bit- Queue=0/0 Enable-
        Capabilities: [d0] Express Legacy Endpoint IRQ 0
        Capabilities: [100] Advanced Error Reporting
        Capabilities: [13c] Virtual Channel

I am using the 2.6.18 gentoo kernel with the PCIE, LED and interrupt patches.

Also, I have a wpa_supplicant version 0.5.4.

After the following commands:

ifconfig eth1 up
iwlist eth1 scan
iwconfig eth1 essid &quot;IgorNetwork&quot;

my GNOME shows connection for the eth1 interface. However, there is no transmission. I can't ping, I can't load the page using the wireless connection. The WiFi LED is on after the interface was brought up.

Issuing the command:

iwconfig eth1 enc &lt;key1&gt;

gives following:

Error for wireless request &quot;Set Encode&quot; (8B2A) :
    SET failed on device eth1 ; Operation not supported.

I don't have a passphrase setup apparently, so I am using the key that was generated.

The dmesg output is as follows:

bcm43xx: PHY connected
bcm43xx: Microcode rev 0x127, pl 0xe (2005-04-18  02:36:27)

I attached only the relevant portion of the dmesg output.
If you need I can attach dmesg output after every single command.

Thank you in advance for any suggestion.
