It is straight-forward for me with SoftMAC using openSUSE 10.2 with KDE. In YaST, I told
NetworkServices/NetworkDevices that I was using NM to configure, rather than the ifcfg method. After
logging in, I clicked on the NM helper applet and clicked on the item for my AP. Up popped up a box
for encryption type and key information. I also checked the box saying I wanted my key saved. Now
when I first boot, I need to enter my password for the KDE wallet; however, the much longer WPA
passphrase does not need to be reentered. NM then associates and authenticates with my AP without
further actions by me.

Of course, your distro may be different; however, on my system, NM is easier than anything I've ever
had with any other OS, including Windows XP and openSUSE 10.0. I'm really pleased with it. ATM it
doesn't work with d80211; however, Jiri is working on a fix for that.
