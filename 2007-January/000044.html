<PRE>As noted in this list earlier today, there is now a patch that makes PCI-E interfaces work. It has
only been tested with Dell Wireless 1390 cards (BCM4311), but should also work for BCM4312s. The
receive level for the 4311 is excellent, but the transmit levels are very weak. Copying of a test
file of mine takes 7 sec. with a BCM4306. With the BCM4311, it takes a little over 3 minutes given
the retransmits, etc. Now that the card works (?), my next step is to try to find why the radio has
such low power.

I just ordered additional memory for my laptop and will concentrate on the RAM &gt; 1GB problem for
cards with 30-bit DMA. I tried to debug this remotely, but didn't get very far.

The corrected PCI-E patches have been uploaded to <A HREF="ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.org/patches.">ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.org/patches.</A> There are
versions for 2.6.18 and 2.6.19. That site also has the patches needed to operate the hardware radio
enable switch and the associated LED.
