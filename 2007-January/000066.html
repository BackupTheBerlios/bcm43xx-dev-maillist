<PRE>Greetings;

I have bcm43xx setup now, and if I assign its address as opposed to using 
dhcp, it appears to work.

Appears is the correct word I think, because its not receiving anything 
although I can:

ssh into the dd-wrt and watch the packet counts rise with an ifconfig for 
both the ath0 and wifi0 interfaces.

run etherape on the lappy, which puts the interface wlan0 into promiscuous 
mode, and watch traffic, some of which seems to come to addresses only 
valid outside my local net.  There is currently a 239:255:255:250 address 
being displayed by etherape.  But I note that traffic to this machine 
seems to be missing the final e in this machines alias name.  OTOH, a 
ping -f from here to that machines address doesn't show up in the 
etherape display.  Also the routers hostname is missing the final 
character in the etherape display, so maybe that is an etherape bug.

This has the classic case of a bad route stamped all over it, but a 
route -n on the lappy shows:
Destination	Gateway		genmask		flags	Metric	Use	Iface
192.168.71.2	0.0.0.0		255.255.255.0	u	0	0	wlan0
0.0.0.0		192.168.71.2	0.0.0.0		ug	0	0	wlan0

which is correct.  The dd-wrt's address is 192.168.71.2 so it wouldn't 
clash with the old linksys at 192.168.71.1.

The dd-wrt is functioning as a relay for dns requests also, and works fine 
from the other 2 machines here, all local dns entries are set to 
192.168.71.2.

I can't see the problem, but there sure is one.  Can I buy a clue?

Thanks.
