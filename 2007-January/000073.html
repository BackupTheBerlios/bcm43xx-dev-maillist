Which is odd, because at the same time, the status page of its web page 
was showing 0 incoming packets, but read on dear friends.

</I>&gt;<i>I can't see the problem, but there sure is one.  Can I buy a clue?
</I>
As an experiment, I rmmod'd all the bcm43xx and ieee80211* modules, then 
modprobed ndiswrapper, but that did not appear to connect either.
So I rmmod'd ndiswrapper, and modprobed bcm43xx again.  This with 
NetworkManager turned off.  Several seconds later I noted the dd-wrt's 
web page was showing a packets rx'd count that was non-zero.  And I had a 
working connection!  And, it survived a network restart, and 
NetworkManager being restarted.

But of course its a laptop and will be shut down, which it has been now.
That tells me something in my /etc/modprobe.conf is wrong.  Whats in there 
now is from the bcm43xx-fwcutter packages README.fedora file.  And of 
course it does not work when powered up again.

So there is yet another clue but I don't grok it myself.



&gt;<i>Thanks.
