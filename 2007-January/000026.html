<PRE>&gt;<i> No bcm43xx card works at higher than 11 MBs. Whenever any

Okay, I thought it was something similar.


&gt;<i> As you have git cloned the wireless-2.6 tree, it is very simple to do
</I>&gt;<i> a git pull to update your source. You really should do that as a number
</I>&gt;<i> of bugs that would cause your crashes and hangs have been fixed in the
</I>&gt;<i> past couple of months.
</I>
I finally got around to it, thanks.  In fact, with my untrained git
skills I managed to mess it up due to the patches i'd applied earlier.
 (PCI-E and manually enabling 4311.)

Anyways, I ended up just re-cloning the wireless-2.6 tree using cg-clone.


&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure the problem is with the x86_64 version that I'm running
</I>&gt;<i> No interrupts are delivered to the software.
</I>
I've been meaning to set up a partition with a 64-bit installation of
Ubuntu or something, so when I manage to do that I'll let you know.


On to the results:

I compiled and installed wireless-2.6 with no problems.  Bcm43xx was
detected, and you are right, it seems much more stable. Even the
radio-enable light turns on and off appropriately when I toggle the
switch.

Unfortunately, though, it acts as if it the radio is turned off.  I
cannot associate with any AP, and &quot;iwlist eth2 scan&quot; lists nothing.

Now that I'm on an untouched wireless-2.6 kernel, I'll try to git-pull
more often and test whenever updates are available.

(Is this the best method for testing the latest changes? I could apply
patches manually, but I'll have to learn how to &quot;undo&quot; those in git
properly.)


Anyways, I'll end this message with my &quot;dmesg|grep bcm&quot; output.

Thanks,
Steve
