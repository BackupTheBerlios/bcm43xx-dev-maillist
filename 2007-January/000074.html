</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, sure. I know that this is the commit which introduced this.

</I>&gt;<i> That's inconsistent.  dma_alloc_coherent() is very picky on x86_64 and crashes

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at the patch, it's clear that the SSB device is used instead of the PCI

</I>
Already done. Please pull my tree and check if it still crashes.

&gt;<i> The patch is attached.  It fixes the crash.  I didn't check that it's complete.
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't like the long chain of dereferences, and I hope you'll come up
</I>&gt;<i> with something better.
</I>
No. I don't think we have shorter chains in other subsystems like PCI. They
are just hidden.

We could probably get rid of one level in the DMA code, by embedding the DMA
structs into the device struct. But I think there are more important things
to do at the moment.

&gt;<i> I still cannot associate.  The kernel log is attached.  Notice massive assertion
</I>&gt;<i> failures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that LO calibration is horribly broken in my tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that's what the assertion failures are about.
</I>
You're right.

&gt;<i> &gt; So you have a very weak signal, if any. My 4318 has no signal, for example.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So basically don't expect to be able to transmit any data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This includes association.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I could scan, and I got 7 access points around.  Only one is in my
</I>&gt;<i> apartment.
</I>
RX sensitivity is not quite as bad.

&gt;<i> &gt; But I think you should be able to assoc with a plain linville tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope.  Although I got DadWifi to work, and this message will we sent over it.
</I>&gt;<i> So it's not like I'm missing something essential about d80211 stack.
</I>
Well, I don't really know what to do all about this.
It's strange. I have people reporting that exactly the same cards work
and people reporting that exactly the same cards don't work over and
over again.
So, well. What to do? :)
