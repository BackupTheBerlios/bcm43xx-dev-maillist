If the LED that shows the radio switch state were different than the one used to show activity, then
I would agree with you; however, it is the same one. If we want the light on when the switch is on
(and the interface is up) and I think we do, then we need the behavior I coded.

If there were a way to determine if the hardware-enabled bit were determined by a switch, then we
could make activelow conditional, but that is not the case. It doesn't matter to me as my switch is
a slide, and I always know if the radio is enabled; however, a lot of them are momentary switches
that seem to toggle a bit in the hardware. Those people need positive feedback that the radio is
enabled. Without the activelow, their light would be on if the radio were off, and vice versa. That
would be too much confusion!
