Yeah, sure. I know that this is the commit which introduced this.

Note that LO calibration is horribly broken in my tree.
So you have a very weak signal, if any. My 4318 has no signal, for example.
So basically don't expect to be able to transmit any data.
This includes association.

But I think you should be able to assoc with a plain linville tree.

&gt;<i> So, the oops was introduced in the transition to the new SSB.

Yeah, but I don't see where we can get such an oops from :)

dito.

&gt;<i> &gt; Well, ok. So it should work in my tree, too, once we fixed the DMA oops.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You mean there is a reason for me to think that your changes would fix

</I>
No.


We oops in dma_alloc_coherent, right?
Where can we get a NULL pointer there? I don't see it. Any idea?
Also, regarding to the oops message, it's oopsing somewhere at
the beginning of the function.
