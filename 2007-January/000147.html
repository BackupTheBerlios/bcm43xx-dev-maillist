Did you apply that d80211 rmmod crash fix that Michael Wu posted
recently. I bet it will fix your issue.

&gt;<i> The driver connects to a 802.11b Linksys router just fine.  I can send
</I>&gt;<i> and receive data.  The driver is fully functional.  128-bit WEP is
</I>&gt;<i> supported.
</I>
Nice.

&gt;<i> There are periodic bursts of assertion failures.  Looking at the driver,
</I>&gt;<i> I see three places where lna a.k.a. phy-&gt;lo_gain[0] is assigned the
</I>&gt;<i> value of 32 (written as 0x20 in one place).  It's not surprising that it
</I>&gt;<i> exceeds 7 in lo_measure_feedthrough().
</I>
I know about these and I am going to fix that, soon.
Ignore it for the time being, please.

&gt;<i> I think the assert() should be replaced with a FIXME, which would not
</I>&gt;<i> annoy end users so much.
</I>
Well, no. It's kind of: Michael, go ahead and fix that crap!
So I'd like to keep it to get me to fix it. :D

&gt;<i> And while at that, it would be great to 
</I>&gt;<i> replace phy-&gt;lo_gain with four fields with descriptive names.
</I>&gt;<i> phy-&gt;lo_gain is never used as an array.  Alternatively, you could make
</I>&gt;<i> it a structure within bcm43xx_phy.
</I>
Yeah, one step after the other. ;)
We didn't know the meanings of the values until recently. Of course
I am going to rename them.

&gt;<i> The problems with a MadWifi based AP turn out to be related to 802.11g.
</I>&gt;<i> If the AP is configured for 802.11b only, everything is working.  If
</I>&gt;<i> 802.11g is enabled, strange things are happening.  Judging by what's on
</I>&gt;<i> the air, it looks like the driver loses the data frames is receives.
</I>&gt;<i> wpa_supplicant connects instantly, but ARP and ping packets from AP to
</I>&gt;<i> STA are lost.  The frames are even acknowledged, but not seen on the
</I>&gt;<i> station side.  It takes from one to ten minutes util ping suddenly
</I>&gt;<i> starts working.
</I>
Hm, is this 4318? It is known to loose lots of packets.

Greetings Michael.
