<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With respect to the 4311, you will be happy to learn that one of the
</I>&gt;<i> developers (me) now has one. It
</I>&gt;<i> does not work with any of the mainline (2.6.20 or wireless-2.6) kernels,
</I>&gt;<i> nor with stable (2.6.19).
</I>&gt;<i> It does work with the wireless-dev git tree, and I am trying to find the
</I>&gt;<i> critical differences
</I>&gt;<i> between the two trees. When I get a fix, the patches will be posted here.
</I>


For what it's worth, I'm using the bcm43xx driver with wireless-2.6 on my HP
laptop, which has a 4311 card, and it does work.
It's not perfect... it is quite a slow connection (feels like 802.11b), and
after some period of time the device always &quot;resets&quot; and I have to reboot
the laptop, and trying to unload the module causes a crash.  However, it
does work.

Note however that I did this quite a while ago now, I git-cloned
wireless-2.6 and applied a couple of patches about 5 or 6 months ago. Once I
got it working, I didn't keep trying new versions.  (I find kernel
development confusing enough that it takes a lot of energy for me to try
development patches...)

At this point I'd like to start trying again with the latest version of
bcm43xx, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.

Anyways, just to say, wireless-2.6 with 4311 works for me. I don't get that
DMA error you mentioned in the other thread.

Oh, I should mention, the computer as a 64-bit 2xTurion CPU, but I'm
actually running 32-bit Ubuntu, with firmware v3.
