The first thing is to use git to download the latest copy of wireless-2.6. Next go to the
Documentation directory and read CodingStyle, SubmittingPatches, and anything else that catches your
eye. Then you can start reading the code and figuring out how the various pieces work. I would also
learn how to use quilt for handling your patches.

The power issues are the main problem remaining, and I wish you luck with them. You will need to
compare the code with the V3 specifications at <A HREF="http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net,">http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net,</A> which are our
master document. Be aware that some of the specs are vastly different than what they were when the
original driver was written. Before you do a lot of work on anything not meeting those specs, check
with me. I have patches that update almost all the lo (local oscillator) stuff to match the new
specs. These are the softmac equivalent of the things Michael is developing for d80211.

Good luck,

Larry
