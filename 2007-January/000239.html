<PRE>
Hello. I am the owner of a card (a LinkSys Wireless-G WPC54GS (ver.2))
which has a 4318 chip:

kernel: bcm43xx: Chip ID 0x4318, rev 0x2kernel: bcm43xx: Number of cores: 4
kernel: bcm43xx: Core 0: ID 0x800, rev 0xd, vendor 0x4243, enabled
kernel: bcm43xx: Core 1: ID 0x812, rev 0x9, vendor 0x4243, disabled
kernel: bcm43xx: Core 2: ID 0x804, rev 0xc, vendor 0x4243, enabled
kernel: bcm43xx: Core 3: ID 0x80d, rev 0x7, vendor 0x4243, enabled

Last July I wrote to this list about the level of success I was having
with getting the card to work under Debian testing [1]. At that point,
the card was managing to associate with the access point and obtain an
IP address about one time in ten.  That was with kernel version 2.6.17.

I have barely used the card since then---because it wasn't really
usable, and because I scan or read the digest version of this list
every day and my impression from that was that the issues around the
4318 chipsets hadn't really been addressed yet.

However, three days ago, I thought I should try again. I've been using
the card with two slightly different kernel versions: 2.6.18.1
hand-compiled from kernel.org and 2.6.18.3 packaged for Debian.

And it's been working just fine. True, I can't use Debian's ifup
script, and automation utilities like network-manager and KDE's
kwifi-manager also can't create a working connection, but if I do:

  ifconfig wlan up
  iwconfig essid ESSID-NAME
  dhclient wlan

all works consistently very well. That is, I have had no failures of
association at all over the past 3 days, despite more or less
continuous use and despite the fact that I have been deliberately
connecting and disconnecting, suspending and resuming, and so on to
try to test the card (I'm listening to an Irish radio stream with it
just now). Also: `iwlist wlan scan' used to regularly cause hard
lockups of the system, but I haven't been able to induce that
behaviour over the 3 day period either.

The only change here is the kernel version---same laptop, same access
point, same number of access points in the vicinity.

I haven't tried with 2.6.19, but obviously I should.

So this is just a progress report and a note of thanks to you all for
your work. Obviously, I'm happy. But am I wrong to be also a little
bit puzzled?

Jim
