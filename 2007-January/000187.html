It works similarly with Gnome and Gentoo.  I start the NetworkManager
service, and tell the boot scripts not to autostart the network script
for that NIC.  Then, nm-applet stores the keys in the Gnome Keyring.  I
have pam_keyring setup, so I can log in with my keyring passphrase, and
my keyring is automatically unlocked; but if you can't (or don't want)
to do that, you'll just get the password dialog for keyring, same as KDE
wallet.

I have to say, NM is great to use, and I miss it when I can't use it. (I
have a 4318, so I can only use it at work where it's sitting right next
to my AP.  Otherwise, I have to use prism54, which doesn't work with
wpa_supplicant/NM right now, for some reason I haven't tracked down
yet.)
