</I>Well, lets see, I'm hitting the power button to turn it on now. Booting 
2.6.18-01.2257
No problems indicated when it brought up wlan0 during the boot.
Scanning output to tty0.  Every 20 seconds it appears.
logged in.  Ping this box. Network is unreachable.  And none of that stuff 
wants to run before X is started, so I just did.  It looks normal, and 
knetworkmanager's icon in the tray has a red X.

Clicking on it.  It displays 2 essids. I click on mine.  Kwallet password 
requester opens up.  I enter roots pw, and knetworkmanagers main window 
opens, displaying the name and device, and a multiselector that defaults 
to WEP Passphase.  I change it to 'WEP 40/104-bit hex', and change the 
Authentication multiselector to 'shared key' and click on Show 
credentials.  There is no 'save to wallet' option anywhere in this 
window.  Next I have to grab another shell, and do 
a 'cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/keys-wlan0'  This file contains 4 
keys, with key=duplicate of key1.  I grab that top key with a mouseover, 
paste it into the KEY line of that screen which unghosts the connect 
button.  I click on it, there being no other buttons showing.

That window closes and the Activation progress display opens, it goes thru 
the connection setup and I'm connected.  No place in this dialog am I 
offered the chance to save it in the wallet, and once I've given it the 
password the only thing left is the wallet icon, showing opened, in the 
system tray.  And apparently noplace in the wallet is the correct 
settings for the multiselectors saved.

Saved as an .xml file, its fubared IMO. This is it:
-----------------
&lt;wallet name=&quot;kdewallet&quot;&gt;
  &lt;folder name=&quot;knetworkmanager&quot;&gt;
    &lt;map name=&quot;my ESSID string&quot;&gt;
      &lt;mapentry name=&quot;password&quot;&gt;my KEY&lt;/mapentry&gt;
    &lt;/map&gt;
  &lt;/folder&gt;
&lt;/wallet&gt;
------------------
Clicking on it, I see 2 wallets, kdewallet and rootswallet.  To look at 
rootswallet, I had to enter the passwd again, and when displayed, there 
is only the forms templates.

When I click on kdewallet, there is a knetworkmanager entry, and it 
contains the essid and the key I entered as an ESSID-&gt;password entry and 
its correct.  Since rootswallet is empty, I just deleted it.

So, the storage portion seems to be working, now the question is, why is 
it not being used once I give it a valid passwd?

See the above xml file, that doesn't look right to me.

Under passwords in kdewallet, a right click lets me add a new one, I name 
root, and click OK.  But that enters a password of root apparently so I 
delete it.  Then I change the existing passwd just to refresh it, but 
that window on the right never asks me if I want to see it in plaintext, 
which it did when I'd added a new one.

I'm plumb bummfuzzeld, this is a pita having to reconfigure and re-enter 
the proper configuration and key everytime...
