At the moment I am working on the new LO stuff in my tree.
It's horribly broken, but that's the way to fix it.
It seems to be completely non-working on my 4318. Let's see why...
I think there are a bunch of typos in the magic PHY register stuff.
Sometimes a single swapped number makes the operation completely broken.
