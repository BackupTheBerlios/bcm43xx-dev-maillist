Ehm, it is clearly not artificial. The MIPS core depends on the MIPS
platform. Logically and technically. You must not enable it on
non-MIPS platforms, as it's tied with the internals of the MIPS
arch dependent code.

The only logical way to solve the compile issues are to make a dependency
on the MIPS platform.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; drivers/ssb/driver_pci/pcicore.c refers to SSB_PCICORE_SBTOPCI1_CFG1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that is not defined anywhere in the kernel.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, could be a typo. I'll have a look at it.

</I>&gt;<i> I only found it because the driver didn't depend on MIPS.  See what I mean?

</I>&gt;<i> This only manifests if CONFIG_SSB_PCICORE_HOSTMODE is defined, and it is only

</I>
HOSTMODE is not really tested, yet.
And HOSTMODE is _also_ very closely tied to the MIPS platform. So
it must depend on it, too (probably indirectly through the MIPS core driver).

To be honest, I did not even compiletest the HOSTMODE code, as I don't
even have a device for it. But I am going to fix that before pushing stuff
upstream.

&gt;<i> &gt; Hm, not sure why this oopses. It works on PPC (can transmit data and so on).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My PPC machine is a venerable Blue&amp;White G3, so it won't take PCIe.
</I>
I looked more closely at it, but I really can't see why it oopses.
Any idea what's happening there?

&gt;<i> &gt; Does it work with linville's tree (in DMA mode)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it does.  I couldn't connect to the AP, but it's a different story.  I may
</I>&gt;<i> be doing things wrong.  At least I can scan and I see the APs around.
</I>
Well, ok. So it should work in my tree, too, once we fixed the DMA oops.
