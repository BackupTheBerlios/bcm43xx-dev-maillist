In order to get around the (possible) transmit power problem, I set my
own AP to have a hidden SSID, and it's currently sitting about 1 meter
from the laptop.

I've been skimming through the wpa_supplicant source code to try to
get a handle on what's going on.   When ap_scan is set to 1,
wpa_supplicant will walk through all of the entries in the config file
that have &quot;scan_ssid=1&quot; set.  For each of these SSIDs, it tells the
driver to scan for that specific SSID, and when the results come back,
it compares each resulting SSID with the SSID that it was originally
scanning for, looking for an exact string match.

So, it looks like it's the driver's job to scan for a specific SSID,
and insert its name into one of the fields that would ordinarily be
&quot;&lt;hidden&gt;&quot;.  The problem is, even after scanning for a specific SSID,
the results from the driver never contain the SSID that we searched
for.  In the debug output for wpa_supplicant, I see:

0: 00:16:01:11:42:11 ssid='&lt;hidden&gt;' wpa_ie_len=26 rsn_ie_len=22 caps=0x11
   skip - SSID mismatch

That's definitely my access point, but as you can see, the driver
never inserted the correct SSID.
