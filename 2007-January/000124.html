</I>
Chuckle, yes you can, but the method does take many of the available 
output devices, usually a power fet type, and the combiner networks are 
2/3rds of the weight of the whole transmitter.  But yes, I can buy, from 
Larcan for instance, all solid stage transmitters at vhf power levels up 
to 50kw.  An individual device failure costs the output of 2 of them 
because of the combiner physics, but the failure is what we call 
gracefull in that you are still on the air, and at full power until quite 
a few devices have failed.  Oh, bring money too, this is 6 digit stuff 
and the first one is probably more than 3 these days...

In our case, the final is a glass triode originally made by Eimac but now 
they are all being rebuilt from time to time by people such as Econco.  
Its a water cooled anode tube, with about 40 gallons of water a minute 
being pumped through it, then out to a big fan cooled radiator and dumped 
back into about a 200 gallon copper tank that the 10 horse pump pulls 
from.  The fan is quad of torrington wheels about 16&quot; in diameter &amp; 9&quot; or 
so deep on each side, keeping a 15 horse motor around nameplate current 
per phase.  So in the end we move a lot of air.  And we keep the water 
very pure because pure water is an insulator, those 1&quot; id hoses that hook 
to the bottom of the socket have 7200 volts on them. We intercept the 
hoses before they hit grounded stuff so we can read the leakage &amp; know 
when to change the deionizer cartridge, typically reading less than 1 
milliamp, we change the cartridge when it gets up to 2 mills.  Even so we 
change the hose barbs and hoses every so often because the hose barbs are 
corroded away inside the hose where you can't see them.  Blowing a hose 
off whats left of a hose barb makes a mess &amp; takes quite a bit of drying. 

This tube weighs about 30 lbs, 20 of which is the copper anode and water 
jacket, stands about 28&quot; tall, 10&quot; maximum diameter for the grid contact 
ring which is at rf ground, but about -275 volts of bias.  Operated as a 
grounded grid stage, the driver power (about 3 to 4 kw) we feed in not 
only drives the tube, but also comes out as output, that's the nature of 
grounded grid amplifiers.  The tube itself is rated to 75kw 6 mhz wide in 
the low vhf band.  We only need 27kw sync tip peak, so I don't run the 
heaters at full power which would be at 12 volts and 180 amps current.  
Overbuilt for the job, the last one ran for a bit over 10 years.  It 
costs us in the area of $7k to get one rebuilt.  This is the visual, the 
aural is actually a separate transmitter that due to the physics 
of 'intercarrier sound' has been running at about 900 watts for the last 
12 years, its sufficient.

I think the visuao tube we have in now will handily finish out the ntsc 
days which are scheduled to be turned off January 2009 now, only 2 years 
hence.  But stay tuned, the dems are now in power and we're hearing 
rumors of yet another extension, so we're starting to arrange to get one 
of our duds rebuilt just in case.

By now we're what I think could be called off topic though.  The power 
level of this &quot;radio&quot; is about 10ee+07 of what a bcm43xx can do. :-)
