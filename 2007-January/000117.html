I think this must be a fairly common way for HP at least to do it.  The 
switch on my HP dv5120us feels like a momentary of some sort, and in 
windows it turns the radio on and off.  However it seems to be a bit 
confused for linux, if its on, and the led in the hinge is on, then 
there's a 50% chance the radio is on.  Tapping the button in linux turns 
off the led, but never turns it back on, so I have to tap the button and 
restart the network, repeat till the led comes on.  However, iwconfig and 
iwlist appear to report that it is functioning when in fact it is not 
until the magic twanger combo of button taps and network restarts finally 
manages to enable the led again.

In other words, it appears that button status and led status to make it 
work are a real crap shoot.  Communication between the button and the 
radio certainly seems broken on my lappy.  It BTW has a bcm4318 radio in 
it.
