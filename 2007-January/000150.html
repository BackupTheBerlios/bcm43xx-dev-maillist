That shouldn't happen and doesn't for me.

No, well... . remove_interface should have been called by the stack, no?

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I cannot come to a satisfactory solution yet.  If I call

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I think it's a bad idea to unlock any mutexes or other locks

</I>&gt;<i> until it (the caller) unlocks it.  Unlocking locks from other functions
</I>&gt;<i> breaks this convention. 
</I>
It would result in a deadlock, if we don't unlock it there. That's
perfectly fine.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think the assert() should be replaced with a FIXME, which would not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; annoy end users so much.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, no. It's kind of: Michael, go ahead and fix that crap!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I'd like to keep it to get me to fix it. :D
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I, for one, prefer to keep my to-do items in my to-do list, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to distract you with petty arguments from fixing the real problem.
</I>
Well, assert() statements are there to find bugs. And if there is a bug,
they trigger. That's pretty much the semantics of an assert() statement.
I'm not sure why you want to hide a bug.

Either way, in this case it seems like the code is right
and just the assert() mask is wrong. But that's only this way by luck.
Could easily have been the other way around. ;)
Specs were slightly wrong at this point.

But as I said, I will commit a fix today.

&gt;<i> &gt; Hm, is this 4318? It is known to loose lots of packets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, it's 4312.
</I>
That has got the same problems.
