No bcm43xx card works at higher than 11 MBs. Whenever any of the higher rates are selected, the TX
signal strength drops considerably.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note however that I did this quite a while ago now, I git-cloned

</I>&gt;<i> Once I got it working, I didn't keep trying new versions.  (I find
</I>&gt;<i> kernel development confusing enough that it takes a lot of energy for me

</I>
As you have git cloned the wireless-2.6 tree, it is very simple to do a git pull to update your
source. You really should do that as a number of bugs that would cause your crashes and hangs have
been fixed in the past couple of months.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point I'd like to start trying again with the latest version of
</I>&gt;<i> bcm43xx, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyways, just to say, wireless-2.6 with 4311 works for me. I don't get
</I>&gt;<i> that DMA error you mentioned in the other thread.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, I should mention, the computer as a 64-bit 2xTurion CPU, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> actually running 32-bit Ubuntu, with firmware v3.
</I>
I'm pretty sure the problem is with the x86_64 version that I'm running. No interrupts are delivered
to the software.
