So in this respect, ndiswrapper is ahead of bcm43xx then as it had no 
problem like this.  I have it connecting now with ndiswrapper loaded, but 
while ifconfig says the interface is up, apparently routes aren't being 
properly set to that interface.  And I was too tired to investigate 
further, still am in fact.

Could the low tx power Larry alluded to also be a bcm43xx problem?

Can you relate what was added in v4, and in v5?

&gt;&gt;<i> That's a bit confusing since the chip, from the way I'm reading that

</I>&gt;<i>The revision numbers (0x13f, 0x127) are not any chip revisions. These
</I>&gt;<i>are microcode revisions and they are defined in the firmware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The md5sums which do not match was a bug in the old 004 version of
</I>&gt;<i>fwcutter.
</I>
I see.

&gt;<i>The extraction parameters for some v4 bcmwl5.sys driver files 
</I>&gt;<i>(IIRC, it was 4.10.40.0 and 4.10.40.1) were wrong. But this was fixed in
</I>&gt;<i>fwcutter release 005.
</I>
The rpms apparently do not maintain that fine a grain to the version 
numbers, all I get for the query --version is 004

And this is available as an rpm for FC5?  Where?  I have extras and 
updates-testing enabled in yum, but didn't see a new bcm43xx-fwcutter 
yesterday, nor do I now.

Thanks Martin.
