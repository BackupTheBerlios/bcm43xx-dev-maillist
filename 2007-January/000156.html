</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First, thanks a lot for your work on the driver.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, my observations: With the patch from

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on top of 2.6.20-rc5 (x86_64), the bcm4311 card in my HPC nx6325 partially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works (I use the ieee80211softmac version of the driver).  Namely, everything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems to be going on well and and interrupts are coming, I can run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;iwlist eth2 scan&quot; and it reports something like the following:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but strangely enough this is someone else's access point, not mine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My access point is a D-Link DI-624+ router, with different ESSID and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different MAC.   It stands just next to my machine and yet it is not detected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (it is detected by my second maching with bcm4306, though, and works with it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, please don't bother editing out the ESSID's from your postings. That information can
</I>&gt;<i> be deduced by anyone in your vicinity very quickly, even if your ESSID is hidden.
</I>
This isn't mine, as I said, and that's why it's been edited.  Well, I should
have edited the MAC too, but that isn't so easy to google out. ;-)

[--snip--]
 
&gt;<i> &gt; The first problem is the D-Link router not being detected, but I think someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; else has already reported similar problems with a D-Link access point, so it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems there's something wrong with the bcm4311 vs D-Link APs in general.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You might try using kismet or ethereal on another wireless device to capture the traffic from the 4311.
</I>
Yes, that sounds promising.

In the meantime I carried out another experiment.  I found an unencrypted AP close
to me and tried to associate with it.  That seemed to work, so I configured the
interface manually with ifconfig and ran tcpdump on it.  Then I received some
traffic from that network and figured out from it that there was the IP 192.168.1.101
in there, so I reconfigured my interface with the address 192.168.1.15 and tried
to ping the other host.  There was no reply (Destination Host Unreachable), so
I started a network monitor (gkrellm) and ran a continuous ping from the
wireless interface.  Then, no transmits were reported by the monitor.

So, it seems, the card is still unable to transmit, although it evidently
receives packets.

&gt;<i> &gt; Of course the second one is the bit rates, but I have no idea if they are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; related to each other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The bit rate output is a bug. Mine does it too - I'll find the problem.
</I>
Ah, I see there's a patch already.  I'll try it and report back.

Greetings,
Rafael
