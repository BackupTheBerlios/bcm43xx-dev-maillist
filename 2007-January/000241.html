</I>&gt;<i> Last July I wrote to this list about the level of success I was having
</I>&gt;<i> with getting the card to work under Debian testing [1]. At that point,
</I>&gt;<i> the card was managing to associate with the access point and obtain an

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have barely used the card since then---because it wasn't really

</I>&gt;<i> every day and my impression from that was that the issues around the
</I>&gt;<i> 4318 chipsets hadn't really been addressed yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, three days ago, I thought I should try again. I've been using
</I>&gt;<i> the card with two slightly different kernel versions: 2.6.18.1
</I>&gt;<i> hand-compiled from kernel.org and 2.6.18.3 packaged for Debian.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And it's been working just fine. True, I can't use Debian's ifup

</I>&gt;<i> kwifi-manager also can't create a working connection, but if I do:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   ifconfig wlan up
</I>&gt;<i>   iwconfig essid ESSID-NAME
</I>&gt;<i>   dhclient wlan
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> all works consistently very well. That is, I have had no failures of
</I>&gt;<i> association at all over the past 3 days, despite more or less
</I>&gt;<i> continuous use and despite the fact that I have been deliberately
</I>&gt;<i> connecting and disconnecting, suspending and resuming, and so on to
</I>&gt;<i> try to test the card (I'm listening to an Irish radio stream with it
</I>&gt;<i> just now). Also: `iwlist wlan scan' used to regularly cause hard
</I>&gt;<i> lockups of the system, but I haven't been able to induce that
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour over the 3 day period either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only change here is the kernel version---same laptop, same access
</I>&gt;<i> point, same number of access points in the vicinity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't tried with 2.6.19, but obviously I should.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So this is just a progress report and a note of thanks to you all for
</I>&gt;<i> your work. Obviously, I'm happy. But am I wrong to be also a little
</I>&gt;<i> bit puzzled?
</I>
Although we have not made any progress on the transmit strength problem with 4318, 4311 and 4312
chips, we have fixed a great number of bugs that led to lockups, and we continue to make advances.
Kernel 2.6.19 is better than 2.6.18 and 2.6.20 will be even better. In addition, there is a lot of
stuff waiting for 2.6.21, and so on.
