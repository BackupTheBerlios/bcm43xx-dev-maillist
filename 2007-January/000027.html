For future reference, the command 'git checkout -F' will destroy any changes you have made and
revert your git tree to the last one pulled.

</I>&gt;<i> I compiled and installed wireless-2.6 with no problems.  Bcm43xx was

</I>&gt;<i> radio-enable light turns on and off appropriately when I toggle the
</I>&gt;<i> switch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, though, it acts as if it the radio is turned off.  I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot associate with any AP, and &quot;iwlist eth2 scan&quot; lists nothing.
</I>
Please run 'cat /proc/wireless' to see if interrupts are being delivered to the bcm43xx.

&gt;<i> Now that I'm on an untouched wireless-2.6 kernel, I'll try to git-pull
</I>&gt;<i> more often and test whenever updates are available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Is this the best method for testing the latest changes? I could apply
</I>&gt;<i> patches manually, but I'll have to learn how to &quot;undo&quot; those in git
</I>&gt;<i> properly.)
</I>
A good way to apply patches is with the use of quilt. You can use the 'quilt import filename' to add
a patch file to the quilt database. You then use 'quilt push' to apply the patch to the source tree.
If there is a problem, your source is not messed up. To remove that patch file, use 'quilt pop'. If
you want to roll your own patch, use 'quilt new some_descriptive_name', then change the source by
using 'quilt edit source_file_name'. Once you have the source the way you want it, do a 'quilt
refresh' to create the updated patch file.
