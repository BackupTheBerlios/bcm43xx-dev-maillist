The copyright violation issue is solved.
I stopped responsing to the discussion. The issue is solved for me.
If they want to have a broadcom driver in their openbsd they have to
either write it on their own or contact us to get permission to use
code. It's their turn. Although I don't expect them to contact us.

&gt;<i> Did you, Theo, ever consider that the refusable to cross license the other

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think Michael reacted relatively peacefully considering that the code is 
</I>&gt;<i> in the wild now, without his copyright.
</I>
You forgot to CC Theo ;)

&gt;<i> Think about it, both of you, and then do the right thing for both 
</I>&gt;<i> distributions.  IMO, deleting the offending code was, in this case not 
</I>&gt;<i> the optimum path to have traveled, particularly since bsd needs that 
</I>&gt;<i> code.  There are a couple dozen boatloads of machines out there using 
</I>&gt;<i> this chipset.  Including a lappy I bought a year ago.

I am 100% sure that was the worst decision they could do.
But I did not force this on them in any way. It was their decision.
And I respect that.

Greetings Michael.
