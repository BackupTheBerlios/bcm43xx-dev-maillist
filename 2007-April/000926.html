To make it clear. We are not issueing any copyright claims on
these magic register sequences.
This is only about algorithms and so on. I mentioned the LO state
machine, for example.

</I>&gt;<i> 	2. Same as option one, but if my time resources keep

</I>&gt;<i> 	   in the office and I can't fix up the driver soon,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	3. We don't come to a point and I'll plain drop the driver
</I>&gt;<i> 	   directly, very soon.
</I>
	4. bcm43xx people review the driver and think about relicensing
	   (parts of) bcw, so you don't have to rewrite it.
	   We don't want to distrurb bcw development, but we don't like
	   the harsh way of taking code without permission and asking
	   for permission afterwards.
	   If you want to have more code relicensed, please ask on a
	   case-by-case base _before_ importing it into bcw.
