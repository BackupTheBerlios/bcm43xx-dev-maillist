</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is a manifestation of the same problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Device corruption:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;this has been mentioned on the list before, and was also observed here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;When using 2.6.20 unpatched kernel and rebooting the laptop with bcm43xx
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;loaded and interface up, the device gets somehow corrupted.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;After rebooting it was impossible to get the device working again.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Neither with bcm43xx nor ndiswrapper, power off didnt help either. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;only solution I found was to select 'Restore Defaults'-&gt;'Save' in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;laptops BIOS, and the device did work again. (The laptop BIOS version is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;F.06)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;However this issue has been resolved using 2.6.21-rc6 with combined
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;patch applied.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No PCIe device works on an unpatched 2.6.20 kernel. You need 2.6.20.4 or 
</I>&gt;<i> later. The reason is that PCIe interrupts are not passed on, which 
</I>&gt;<i> obviously confuses your BIOS, and jams up interrupts on the appropriate IRQ 
</I>&gt;<i> line. I'm surprised that turning off the power didn't get it reset.
</I>
I finally found out what my &quot;corruption bug&quot; was about:

In kernel 2.6.20.4 the LED didn't work, when pressing the switch (btw. it
is not directly on the keyboard, but a separate switch right above, with
an integrated LED) and there were no &quot;Radio hardware status changed&quot; messages.
So I assumed the switch doesnt work at all. But that was wrong, I silently
disabled the device (with the LED still on) and it stayed disabled, even when
turning power off.
All I should have done, was to press the switch once more (even with LED
already on), instead of resetting the BIOS. Finding this kept me busy for
a few hours...

In patched 2.6.21-rc6 LED works fine, and the &quot;Radio hardware status
changed&quot; messages show up. Again I was wrong in thinking the switch
doesnt turn off the device properly. It just doesnt switch off immediately.
After pressing and the LED is off, you still have a result from &quot;iwlist
scan&quot; for a some seconds, before the device is finally disabled -
bad tester I am.

I try to describe the LEDs behaviour:
 1. Initial boot, hardware enabled, LED is off, no module loaded
 2. modprobe bcm43xx, ifconfig ethx up
 3. LED is on, Device is working
 4. Reboot
 5. Hardware enabled, LED is on, no module loaded
 6. modprobe bcm43xx
 7. LED goes off
 8. ifconfig ethx up
 9. LED goes on, device is working
10. pressing WLAN switch
11. LED goes off, device is not working
12. Power off, Boot
13. Hardware disabled, LED is off, no module loaded
14. modprobe bcm43xx, ifconfig ethx up
15. LED doesn't turn on, hardware still disabled, device not working
16. pressing WLAN switch
17. LED goes on, device is working

This is all ok and I dont know if other devices are the same, but I
could imagine a different behaviour:

- loading the module initially disables the hardware, never mind if it
  was enabled or disabled before

- doing ifconfig ethx up enables hardware (and LED)
  or
  pressing WLAN switch enables hardware and does ifconfig ethx up

- doing ifconfig ethx down disables hardware
  or
  pressing WLAN switch disables hardware and does ifconfig ethx down

- doing a reboot disables the hardware and turns the LED off.


&gt;<i> &gt;Rate settings:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;setting a rate with iwconfig seems to have no effect, its always 1M
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(with ndiswrapper its always 54M). But this could be a result of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;unsupported wireless extensions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Warning: Driver for device eth1 has been compiled with version 22
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of Wireless Extension, while this program supports up to version 20.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Some things may be broken...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No - The VERSION message is just a standard one. With 2.6.21-rc6, the rate 
</I>&gt;<i> is initialized at 24M. If it has been downgraded to 1M, it must be a 
</I>&gt;<i> consequence of the strength of your signal. What are the signal strengths, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc. shown by iwconfig?
</I>
Ah, I had no AP associated, so no signal strength and no rate changing.

Thanks for helping and all the explanation!

Philipp
