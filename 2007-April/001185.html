There are at least two versions of the BCM4306. Mine is the one with a PHY revision of 1, which has 
the driver do almost everything. Later versions have the firmware doing more of the work and they 
are better. Michael Buesch has one of the later versions. Being a long ways from the AP will make it 
worse; however, I am usually only 2 m from my AP and I couldn't associate.

That won't be necessary. Once we get the power from the mac80211 version that we get from softmac, 
then we will be able to connect at a much higher rate.
