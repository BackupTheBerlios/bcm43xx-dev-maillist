Perhaps that is your penalty for computing rather than gambling. :-) I'm a resident of Nevada and we 
need the gaming tax income.

I don't know about the system hang when rmmod'ing the driver. I do that all the time here without 
any problems. There probably is some time window that you were unlucky enough to hit. Issuing an 
ifdown before the rmmod should fix that.

I have not tested trying to change AP's. What support software were you using? Was it just plain 
ifup/ifdown or something else like NetworkManager? Have you been able to associate with several AP's 
with the older version?

I don't know of anything in either bcm43xx or softmac that would cause it to try automatic roaming 
or change the ESSID. Perhaps someone else in the list knows better.
