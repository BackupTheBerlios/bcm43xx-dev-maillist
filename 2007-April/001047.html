<PRE>Hi all,


HP Compaq nx6325 laptop was already on the list for a few times, so I
would like to add my experiences:

Im using kernel 2.6.21-rc6 with combined_2.6.21-rc6.patch applied.

lspci -vn reports:
30:00.0 0280: 14e4:4312 (rev 01)

dmesg after modprobe bcm43xx and ifconfig eth1 up:
bcm43xx driver
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:30:00.0[A] -&gt; GSI 18 (level, low) -&gt; IRQ 20

bcm43xx: Detected Radio: ID: 2205017f (Manuf: 17f Ver: 2050 Rev: 2)
bcm43xx: Radio turned off
bcm43xx: Radio turned off
bcm43xx: PHY connected
bcm43xx: Microcode rev 0x118, pl 0x17 (2004-05-06  21:34:00)
bcm43xx: Radio turned on
bcm43xx: Radio enabled by hardware
bcm43xx: Chip initialized
bcm43xx: 32-bit DMA initialized
bcm43xx: Keys cleared
bcm43xx: Selected 802.11 core (phytype 2)

First question:
Shouldnt the driver report Chip ID 0x4312 as lspci does? 

Second: How important is the firmware version? Im using 3.70.22.0, as
recommended by Larry, but was also able to load 3.100.65.1, so I don't
know if this has an impact on the driver.

btw, if it helps for development of 4.x support, the latest HP driver
for the nx6325 is located at
<A HREF="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp34001-34500/sp34152.exe">http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp34001-34500/sp34152.exe</A> with firmware
version 4.100.15.5.


LED functionality:

after `ifconfig eth1 up' the LED turns on, and using the WLAN keyboard
switch turns the LED on and off. But this has no impact on the driver,
WLAN seems to work, even with LED turned off.

Using ndiswrapper, the LED turns on right after loading the module and
the keyboard switch turns LED on and off and additionally
enables/disables the device.

With both drivers, when rebooting the laptop with LED switched on, it
stays on, even when no driver is loaded and no device is available. So I
manually unload the driver during shutdown, so the LED goes off before
rebooting.


Device corruption:

this has been mentioned on the list before, and was also observed here:
When using 2.6.20 unpatched kernel and rebooting the laptop with bcm43xx
loaded and interface up, the device gets somehow corrupted.
After rebooting it was impossible to get the device working again.
Neither with bcm43xx nor ndiswrapper, power off didnt help either. The
only solution I found was to select 'Restore Defaults'-&gt;'Save' in the
laptops BIOS, and the device did work again. (The laptop BIOS version is
F.06)

However this issue has been resolved using 2.6.21-rc6 with combined
patch applied.

  
Rate settings:

setting a rate with iwconfig seems to have no effect, its always 1M
(with ndiswrapper its always 54M). But this could be a result of
unsupported wireless extensions?

Warning: Driver for device eth1 has been compiled with version 22
of Wireless Extension, while this program supports up to version 20.
Some things may be broken...


As I'm a new user, thats all I can report for the moment, I have no
experience in stabilty, performance, encryption settings for the bcm43xx
driver yet.


Regards, Philipp
