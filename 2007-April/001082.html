The device renaming logic is not in the driver at all, but rather is
part of udev.

In Debian, there is a udev rule file
(etc/udev/persistent-net-generator.rules) which generates mappings
between device MAC addresses and network device names. It stores the
mappings in /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules.

When you first loaded the in-kernel bcm43xx driver, a persistent rule
was generated for your card's MAC address. When you then go and load
the bcm43xx_mac80211 driver, udev gets confused because the new driver
creates 2 interfaces with the same MAC address (wmaster0 and wlan0).
Wmaster0 happens to be created first, so udev matches this with the
interface name created previously and renames wmaster0 to eth0 (or
whatever the name was with the in-kernel driver). Then the real
interface shows up, and udev finds that the name is already taken, so
it renames wlan0 to wlan0_rename (and does not create a new persistent
rule).

The fix is to edit /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules, and add
ADDRS{type}=&quot;1&quot; to the rule for your card (be sure to keep the parts
of the rule comma-separated). This will prevent it from matching the
wmaster0 interface, and cause your card to have the same name with
both drivers.

Alternatively, if you prefer to have the drivers get different
interface names, you can change the existing rule for your card so
that it only matches when the old driver is used. To do this, change
DRIVERS==&quot;?*&quot; to DRIVERS==&quot;bcm43xx&quot;. Udev will then create a new rule
for the new driver.

Either way, the change will take effect when the driver is reloaded.

This will bite almost everyone who switches drivers. Do we have a FAQ
I can add this to?
