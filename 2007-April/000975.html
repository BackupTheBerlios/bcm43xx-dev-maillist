Excuse my ignorance, please, but I don't see where the real problem is.
What's the problem with taking openHAL and putting it into the yet to
be written GPLed linux atheros driver, while preserving your copyright
notices. I don't see how this could violate the BSD license.

Such stuff is going on day by day. One good example of BSD code put into
code with another license was MS with the NT TCP stack. At least of my
knowledge that was the FreeBSD stack, until they rewrote it.

So, what's the problem, really? Create a derivative work, where
the original openHAL parts are still de-facto BSD licensed, but the rest
is GPLed.

&gt;<i> From my point of view GPL software is non-free because I cannot simply

</I>
Well, so is the license. Put your work under the GPL and you are
free to use the code. (Or alternatively ask the copyright holder(s)
to relicense).
