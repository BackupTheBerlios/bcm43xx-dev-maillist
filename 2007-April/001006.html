<PRE>Possibly.  I'll ensure an ifdown before rmmod in the future.  Upon my 
return to home it associated and wep'ized but was still unable to 
exchange traffic (rxcount and txcount incrementing on if, wireshark sees 
traffic, but the interface refuses to stay ifconfig'd up with an ip.  
Turns radio off. Makes ip go away.  Solid 85/100 on the iwconfig.  rmmod 
bcm43xx; ndiswrapper works.)

Removed new modules from the ftp download, make modules_install in the 
kernel source tree from 03/30, modprobe bcm43xx... works ok. 

Plain iwconfig/ifconfig not even using network-scripts.  Various APs at 
the Golden Nugget, McCarran, and now my house.  Work fine with older 
code.  Work with ndiswrapper.  Did not work with newer code, although 
like I said it wasn't that it &quot;failed&quot; but rather wouldn't stay up long 
enough to pass IP packets or keep the address on the interface.

Let me know what other diagnostics/tests I can run... I just got back 
from five days in Vegas, so I need a drink and some debugging to unwind ;)

</I>&gt;<i> I have not tested trying to change AP's. What support software were you using? Was it just plain

</I>&gt;<i> with the older version?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know of anything in either bcm43xx or softmac that would cause it to try automatic roaming 
</I>&gt;<i> or change the ESSID. Perhaps someone else in the list knows better.
