<PRE>&gt;<i> The loss of connection and the low data rate may both be due to 
</I>&gt;<i> interference. The bcm43xx driver would be more susceptible than would 
</I>&gt;<i> ndiswrapper (see below). Have you tried changing channels? The obvious 
</I>&gt;<i> choices would be 1, 6, or 11 depending on other AP's in your vicinity. 
</I>&gt;<i> In my case, no other user was on channel 1, but I couldn't make a 
</I>&gt;<i> connection. Channel 2 was better, 3 even better and I now use 4. My 
</I>&gt;<i> fastest transfer speeds are at 36M.
</I>
The network I use (I'm abroad for a few months) is out of my hands, and 
they use 6 and 11. One is WPA secured, the other is open, both are large 
infrastructures. There are mostly no other networks around. Testing 
other channels would have to wait until July on my part, though. Unless 
maybe ad-hoc networking with a peer at 1 meters distance is of any use.


&gt;<i> You are seeing the received signal. It is the transmitted signal that is 
</I>&gt;<i> a problem with all cards, but we are working on it.
</I>
OK. Tell me if there's anything I can do to help out. I definitely 
prefer a semi-open solution to the wrapper one.
