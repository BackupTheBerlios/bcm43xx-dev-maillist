</I>
I don't want to accuse anybody. Please see the context. I was trying to
explain why I think bcw developers went public about this issue even
before we noticed about it, and this seems to imply direct copy. (But hey,
I'm not against direct copy, even! I just agree with Michael about this.)

&gt;<i> It should be obvious to anyone who actually goes and reads it, that
</I>&gt;<i> the remainder Marcus' driver shows that he IS TRYING TO TAKE A GOOD

</I>
I _think_ and hope this.

&gt;<i> Michael's initial overly public statemen did not dispute Marcus
</I>&gt;<i> obviously tried to do the right thing, but your agressiveness DOES
</I>&gt;<i> dispute it.  Your sentence:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not even trying to hide that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is exceedingly agressive.  If you have an agenda here, please make
</I>&gt;<i> it clear.
</I>
I'm really sorry if this has been perceived as aggressive. I don't want to
be aggressive. See above, for the reason why I wrote this sentence.
 
&gt;<i> Right about now I think you (Stefano) don't understand that every word
</I>&gt;<i> you say is leading certain people to abandon even trying to write an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative Broadcom driver.
</I>
I can't really agree with this. I think you should at least explain why.

&gt;<i> And ... if what you really want is that another Broadcom driver does
</I>&gt;<i> not come into existance, then just say so.  If that is your agenda,
</I>&gt;<i> say so loud and clear, so that we can know.
</I>
My agenda:
