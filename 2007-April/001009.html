I've seen bcm43xx go crazy when I specify AP manually or make it
re-associate.  In one case, I observed the card sending packet using the
old AP as the BSSID and the new AP and the destination address.  &quot;iwpriv
ethX ap auto&quot; makes the AP show as &quot;Invalid&quot; with no possibility to
recover.

My rule is to always unload bcm43xx before trying to associate to
another AP and to never set AP manually.

I realize that it's an issue with softmac, and that softmac in the
kernel is not the latest.  Perhaps it should be upgraded, but I'm not
very good at convincing people, and I'm vary of starting another massive
tread before I catch up with my e-mail queue.
