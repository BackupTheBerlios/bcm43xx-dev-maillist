The patch that makes the biggest change in speed is in 2.6.21-rc1 and later. There are additional 
improvements that won't be in mainline until 2.6.22-rc1. This is a consequence of the development 
model for Linux. Once a new release is available, there is a period (usually 2 weeks) where any new 
features and code enhancements are accepted. Once the -rc1 stage is reached, only bug fixes are 
accepted. Any feature enhancements such as an updating of the specifications are not considered a 
bug fix unless they fix a kernel crash. As you can imagine, there are usually code improvements that 
miss the window, thus are waiting to be included in mainline. These are always available at 
<A HREF="ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.org/patches">ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.org/patches</A> in the form of a patch file named combined_2.6.xx.y.patch. The 
code base in Linville's wireless-2.6 git tree is usually up to date as well.

BTW, my 4311 gets download speeds of up to 1700 Mbs and uploads of 750 Mbs. We still have room for 
improvement as Windows gets an upload of 1900 Mbs, but at least the 4311 is faster than my broadband 
line with 7 Mbs down and 0.5 Mbs up.
