I also get the unexplained printk suppressed messages that I don't understand.

I also do not understand the sluggish performance from your BCM4312. I though it had the same radio 
and PHY as the 4311. If you have seen my previous reports of performance on the 4306, 4318 and 4311 
chips, all of them were run with WPA enabled. I don't run any other way.

Please use iwconfig to check the rate that is set. It should be 24M. If not, try setting that rate. 
If it is 24M, try 11M, which usually helps an interface that is having trouble at 24M. Your peak 
rate is diminished but the throughput is much better because of fewer retransmits.
