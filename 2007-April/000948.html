</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;This is only about algorithms and so on. I mentioned the LO state

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The last thing I want is to start a license war with you guys,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And of course we want to solve that license issue ASAP.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So, I am suggestion three options:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 	1. You give me some time and I try to rewrite the code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 	   in question.  We keep in touch, and maybe we can split
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 	   up both parties in freedom afterwards.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 	2. Same as option one, but if my time resources keep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 	   shrinking like they do right now, spending weekends
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 	   in the office and I can't fix up the driver soon,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 	   I'll drop the driver.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 	3. We don't come to a point and I'll plain drop the driver
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 	   directly, very soon.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;	4. bcm43xx people review the driver and think about relicensing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;	   (parts of) bcw, so you don't have to rewrite it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;	   We don't want to distrurb bcw development, but we don't like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;	   the harsh way of taking code without permission and asking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;	   for permission afterwards.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;	   If you want to have more code relicensed, please ask on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;	   case-by-case base _before_ importing it into bcw.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I find the lack of being able to read both sides of this thread
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without being subscribed to the BSD lists rather upsetting.  Please,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if one side of this fight is going to carry on this discussion on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public list, then both sides should.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Now having read the full thread, and considering Theo's widely known 
personality, then add in that I was once chastized for asking what I 
considered to be a valid question at the time, by none other than 
Michael, I must say that both of you need to come to the table with 
productive ideas and quit acting like children.

Did you, Theo, ever consider that the refusable to cross license the other 
code mentioned, just might have a teeny wee bit of a bearing on how 
Micheal would respond when, after requesting some BSD code and being told 
to go fish, that Michael in turn might be more than a little upset to 
find his code, essentialy verbatum but sans credits in a BSD cvs repo?

I think Michael reacted relatively peacefully considering that the code is 
in the wild now, without his copyright.

Think about it, both of you, and then do the right thing for both 
distributions.  IMO, deleting the offending code was, in this case not 
the optimum path to have traveled, particularly since bsd needs that 
code.  There are a couple dozen boatloads of machines out there using 
this chipset.  Including a lappy I bought a year ago.
