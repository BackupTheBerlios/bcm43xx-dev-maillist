I'm sorry if the mail sounded too strong. This was not intentional.
But I think I made a great effort to make this clear, though.
I am not out for blood.

&gt;<i> I mean, if I were him, why would I bother going on,

To get your broadcom cards working on bsd??
Really, there's no single other reason to write a driver.

I did _never_ base by arguments on these things. I explicitely
marked these things in the mail as being EXAMPLES for the most
obvious 1:1 copying going on.

&gt;<i> I'd say he did the right thing to give up.
</I>
Only if you don't need a Broadcom wireless driver.
