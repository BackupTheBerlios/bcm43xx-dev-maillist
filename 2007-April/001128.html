The loss of connection and the low data rate may both be due to interference. The bcm43xx driver 
would be more susceptible than would ndiswrapper (see below). Have you tried changing channels? The 
obvious choices would be 1, 6, or 11 depending on other AP's in your vicinity. In my case, no other 
user was on channel 1, but I couldn't make a connection. Channel 2 was better, 3 even better and I 
now use 4. My fastest transfer speeds are at 36M.

You are seeing the received signal. It is the transmitted signal that is a problem with all cards, 
but we are working on it.
