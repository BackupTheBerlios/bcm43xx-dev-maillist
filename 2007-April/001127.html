They may be this (debugging enabled):
bcm43xx: set security called, .level = 0, .enabled = 0, .encrypt = 0


&gt;<i> I also do not understand the sluggish performance from your BCM4312. I 
</I>&gt;<i> though it had the same radio and PHY as the 4311. If you have seen my 
</I>&gt;<i> previous reports of performance on the 4306, 4318 and 4311 chips, all of 
</I>&gt;<i> them were run with WPA enabled. I don't run any other way.
</I>
&gt;<i> Please use iwconfig to check the rate that is set. It should be 24M. If 
</I>&gt;<i> not, try setting that rate. If it is 24M, try 11M, which usually helps 
</I>&gt;<i> an interface that is having trouble at 24M. Your peak rate is diminished 
</I>&gt;<i> but the throughput is much better because of fewer retransmits.
</I>
The sluggishness disappeared with rate 11M. It was at 24M like you 
assumed. But the connection is still lost after a few minutes. It then 
takes a minute before it automatically (most of the time) reconnects.

As I see it, there are two shortcomings of the driver at this point:
- Unability to work reliably at other than 11M
- Unability to keep a stable connection

The signal is obviously good enough to support rates up to 54M. I have 
been able to download at speeds around 1,4 Mb/s which is over 11Mbit/s 
with control traffic - when connected at 24M or 54M with ndiswrapper, 
that is.

I'll be happy to do more testing if anyone needs it.
