</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First question:
</I>&gt;<i> Shouldnt the driver report Chip ID 0x4312 as lspci does? 
</I>
No. The PCI id is different from the chip ID. Actually the programming of the device is mostly 
dependent on PHY and radio parameters.

&gt;<i> Second: How important is the firmware version? Im using 3.70.22.0, as
</I>&gt;<i> recommended by Larry, but was also able to load 3.100.65.1, so I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know if this has an impact on the driver.
</I>
It shouldn't matter.

&gt;<i> btw, if it helps for development of 4.x support, the latest HP driver
</I>&gt;<i> for the nx6325 is located at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp34001-34500/sp34152.exe">http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp34001-34500/sp34152.exe</A> with firmware
</I>&gt;<i> version 4.100.15.5.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> LED functionality:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> after `ifconfig eth1 up' the LED turns on, and using the WLAN keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> switch turns the LED on and off. But this has no impact on the driver,
</I>&gt;<i> WLAN seems to work, even with LED turned off.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using ndiswrapper, the LED turns on right after loading the module and
</I>&gt;<i> the keyboard switch turns LED on and off and additionally
</I>&gt;<i> enables/disables the device.
</I>
In bcm43xx, the LED will never turn on until after the interface is brought up. That is deliberate. 
Are there any messages about &quot;Radio hardware status changed&quot; in the dmesg output? My laptop with a 
4311 has a switch on the front lip, not on the keyboard, the LED changes with the switch and the 
radio is disabled by the hardware. If yours behaves differently, we should change it, but if the 
hardware status changes do not propagate, I'm not sure what we can do.

&gt;<i> With both drivers, when rebooting the laptop with LED switched on, it
</I>&gt;<i> stays on, even when no driver is loaded and no device is available. So I
</I>&gt;<i> manually unload the driver during shutdown, so the LED goes off before
</I>&gt;<i> rebooting.
</I>
That is a manifestation of the same problem.

&gt;<i> Device corruption:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> this has been mentioned on the list before, and was also observed here:
</I>&gt;<i> When using 2.6.20 unpatched kernel and rebooting the laptop with bcm43xx
</I>&gt;<i> loaded and interface up, the device gets somehow corrupted.
</I>&gt;<i> After rebooting it was impossible to get the device working again.
</I>&gt;<i> Neither with bcm43xx nor ndiswrapper, power off didnt help either. The
</I>&gt;<i> only solution I found was to select 'Restore Defaults'-&gt;'Save' in the
</I>&gt;<i> laptops BIOS, and the device did work again. (The laptop BIOS version is
</I>&gt;<i> F.06)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However this issue has been resolved using 2.6.21-rc6 with combined
</I>&gt;<i> patch applied.
</I>
No PCIe device works on an unpatched 2.6.20 kernel. You need 2.6.20.4 or later. The reason is that 
PCIe interrupts are not passed on, which obviously confuses your BIOS, and jams up interrupts on the 
appropriate IRQ line. I'm surprised that turning off the power didn't get it reset.

&gt;<i> Rate settings:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> setting a rate with iwconfig seems to have no effect, its always 1M
</I>&gt;<i> (with ndiswrapper its always 54M). But this could be a result of
</I>&gt;<i> unsupported wireless extensions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Warning: Driver for device eth1 has been compiled with version 22
</I>&gt;<i> of Wireless Extension, while this program supports up to version 20.
</I>&gt;<i> Some things may be broken...
</I>
No - The VERSION message is just a standard one. With 2.6.21-rc6, the rate is initialized at 24M. If 
it has been downgraded to 1M, it must be a consequence of the strength of your signal. What are the 
signal strengths, etc. shown by iwconfig?
