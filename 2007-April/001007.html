Obviously, you weren't in Vegas for fun. After 5 days there, I usually need to take a break from 
drinking, and my mind isn't really good for debugging.

If you could, I would appreciate you grabbing the appropriate combined patch for your kernel and 
testing it. The code should be the same as what was in the tarball, but who knows.

Thanks,

Larry
