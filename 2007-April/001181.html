<PRE>The SoftMAC version of bcm43xx has reached a new level with the release of kernel 2.6.21. For the 
first time, the bcm43xx code in a kernel release works without patching and transmits and receives 
at speeds faster than most Internet connections. As usual, there are enhancements in the pipeline 
that became available after 2.6.21-rc1 was established. As these did not meet the definition of &quot;bug 
fixes&quot;, they have been deferred to 2.6.22-rc1 and following versions. The effects of these on 
transmit and receive speeds in Mbps measured with iperf are as follows for my BCM4311:

iwconfig rate      No patches      With Patches

5.5 Mbs            4.1/10.0           4.2/11.4
6                  4.4/10.6           4.5/14.6
9                  6.2/10.6           6.2/14.1
11                 6.2/9.4            6.5/12.6
18                 10.0/11.5          10.5/16.3
24                 11.8/11.5          12.3/15.6
36                 6.8/10.0           11.8/15.0
48                 1.4/6.4            1.7/8.5

All of these patches are presently found in the wireless-2.6 git tree. As usual, the combined 
patches for 2.6.21 are at <A HREF="ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.org/patches/combined_2.6.21.patch.">ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.org/patches/combined_2.6.21.patch.</A>

Where are improvements still needed? Besides the obvious fall-off with increasing rate as seen in 
the above table, we also have a problem when bcm43xx is used in a congested wireless environment. 
This problem has been reported by several people, but I can now reliably reproduce it using my two 
test computers.

The machine that I use to test PCMCIA modules is very slow. For example recompiling a kernel using 
the configuration of an openSUSE distribution kernel takes roughly 36 hours. To help speed 
development and testing, I have that computer export /home with NFS and cross build the kernels. 
With a BCM4311 on the main machine and a BCM4318 on the slow computer, a full kernel build is 
reduced to about 4 hours. This configuration rarely fails, even with all the network traffic 
involved in pulling sources from, and sending compilation results to, the slow machine. If, however, 
I try to pull a git update from kernel.org, one or both of the interfaces will lose its connection 
to the AP within a a very short time. The only evidence in the logs is an increased frequency of 
scanning, and DHCP connection requests. No disconnection results are logged. Infrequently, bcm43xx 
will log an &quot;IRQ_READY timeout&quot; message. If I change my main computer to a wired connection, the 
git-pull will succeed. An ifdown/ifup sequence usually resumes communication.

If anyone has any thoughts on why bcm43xx and/or SoftMAC should fail under this kind of load, please 
let me know so that I can test.

Thanks,

Larry
