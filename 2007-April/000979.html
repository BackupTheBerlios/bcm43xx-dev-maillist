<PRE>Hello, Reyk!

Quoting Reyk Floeter &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">reyk at openbsd.org</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> I'm sure that somebody forwarded the mails from our private
</I>&gt;<i> discussions to you where I clearly denied the requests to change the
</I>&gt;<i> license of my driver. I do not believe in dual licensing, and it would
</I>&gt;<i> make my driver less free. It does not add a benefit for us but it does
</I>&gt;<i> introduce additional problems. I don't want to take care of GPL
</I>&gt;<i> licensing issues, and I do not want to distinguish between BSD/ISC
</I>&gt;<i> code on the one hand and GPL code on the other hand.
</I>[skip]
&gt;<i> But you make an idiot out of me
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You either totally misinterpreted my statements or you just want to
</I>&gt;<i> spread the FUD that every OpenBSD developer is mind-controlled by
</I>&gt;<i> Theo. I involved Theo _after_ I denied the various requests to change
</I>&gt;<i> the license of my driver because the various people didn't stop to
</I>&gt;<i> repeat their requests. You involved lawyers to question my code.
</I>
OK, I appreciate your explanation.  Indeed, I knew only a part of the story, and
what I knew is very different from what you are writing now.

I did avoid your name and the words like &quot;mind-controlled&quot; in the original post.
 I'm sorry that your name was mentioned in the discussion and that you are
feeling uneasy about my comments.

If you re-read my post, you'll see that I was actually sympathizing with you.

I would really like to stop this thread, because it's watched by too many
people, and any wrong word can do more damage.  I do hope that we'll cooperate
on the blob-free Atheros driver.

Pavel Roskin
