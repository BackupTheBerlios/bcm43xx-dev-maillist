I can't see how you can copy code from bcm43xx to bcw by mistake.
Really, I want to explicitely state that in my opinion the 1:1
copying was going on intentionally. This is impossible to be
a mistake.
Theo, please _do_ compare the code of bcw and bcm43xx. You will find
tons of 1:1 copied code.

&gt;<i> And you are surprised about what has happened?
</I>
Yes I am. I thought you were really interrested in having a Broadcom
wireless driver for openbsd.

&gt;<i> Are you living in 
</I>&gt;<i> a cave?  Are you not human?  Don't you know how people behave when
</I>&gt;<i> they are publically attacked, and not treated with respectful private
</I>&gt;<i> discussion to point out their mistakes?
</I>
This was not a mistake. bcw developers obviously intentionally
copied our code. If you read the bcw commit logs and compare
bcm43xx and bcw code you will see what I mean. Yes, _really_ do this!
Compare it and you'll get my point.

&gt;<i> His deletion of the code has happened for one reason and one reason
</I>&gt;<i> alone -- your way of trying to handle this.
</I>
I don't agree to this.
This sounds more like he lost interrest in getting a clean Broadcom
wireless driver.

Greetings Michael.
