I'm sorry. This GPL violation is too obvious.
Compare the code. Many functions are 1:1 copied. The author of
bcw can't tell me that he did not intentionally violate the GPL
and our copyright.

</I>&gt;<i> increasingly rare Broadcom chipset.
</I>
Marcus Glocker is free to contact us to get a clean relicensing
agreement on the code. I wrote that in the first mail.

&gt;<i> If he quit, I would understand his position completely, based on the
</I>&gt;<i> first contact with him about this issue BEING A PUBLIC DRAG THROUGH
</I>&gt;<i> THE MUD BY YOU GUYS.
</I>
Your code is public. We respond in your public GPL violation in
a public mail.

&gt;<i> This infighting between two teams trying to support the same chipset
</I>&gt;<i> is a complete mockery of the publicness of the original reverse
</I>&gt;<i> engineering effort.  My guess is that Michael is thinking very
</I>&gt;<i> carefully about whether starting the discussion in public was the
</I>&gt;<i> right thing to do, but I am very sure that Stefano jumping in to lob a
</I>&gt;<i> second volley of mud helps noone's cause, especially Michael's cause.
</I>&gt;<i> Stefano, if you want this resolved nicely, I suggest you think before
</I>&gt;<i> you send more mail.
</I>
Please don't attack Stefano. This leads to nothing.
He is also a copyright holder of large amounts of bcm43xx code.

&gt;<i> &gt; Maintaining whitespace and variable names. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Copyrighted whitespaces and variable names, you mean, right?
</I>
We are not talking about variable names of whitespaces.
We are talking about copied code and algorithms.
The examples I brought were just examples.

Greetings Michael.
