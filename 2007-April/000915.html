</I>
Actually, I would be really happy if somebody was &quot;using&quot; the code. We (the
bcm43xx developers) already discussed about dual licensing on Dec,
2005, because we wanted *BSD as well to benefit from our effort. We
then decided not to dual-license any code, because of the reasons
Michael already explained. I thought Michael already expressed our concerns
about BSD license clearly enough, but it looks like he didn't. We aren't
talking about &quot;usage&quot; here, we just don't want proprietary vendors (i.e.
Broadcom) to benefit from our work. I think that we may have different
points of view on this issue, but I think as well that you can understand
our concerns.

&gt;<i> Because right now, in that mail, you've pretty much done Broadcom's
</I>&gt;<i> job for them.  You've told the entire BSD community who may want to
</I>&gt;<i> use a driver for this chip later, that because of a few GPL issues you

That's not what I would call &quot;a few GPL issues&quot;. Really.

&gt;<i> are willing to use very strong words -- published very widely -- to
</I>&gt;<i> disrupt the efforts of one guy who is trying to do things for them.
</I>
You are assuming that we want to disrupt his efforts. I think that this
blatant violation is a big bug for OpenBSD, and it looks you agree on this.
Do you believe in full disclosure, don't you?

&gt;<i> And, you are going to do this using the GPL, even.  You did not
</I>&gt;<i> privately mail that developer.  No, you basically went public with it.
</I>
The bcw developers went public with it. This code was submitted to a
public CVS. With multiple commits. Copying comments. Maintaining
whitespace and variable names. Not even trying to hide that.

&gt;<i> That is how about half the user and developer community will see it.
</I>&gt;<i> They will see your widely posted mail as an overly strong position.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And you have probably royally pissed of a developer working in
</I>&gt;<i> parallel in the same problem space as youself.  Would you be happy to
</I>&gt;<i> receive a mail like you just sent?  No, you would be really disturbed,
</I>&gt;<i> to your soul.
</I>
Personally, I think that what would be more disturbing to my soul is
releasing GPL'd code under a different and incompatible license without even
asking people who wrote it.

&gt;<i> So next time, talk to the specific people, so you don't come off
</I>&gt;<i> as being mean, ok?
</I>
Who is mean here? Again, we aren't out for blood. I don't care for who is
mean here. But if you do, you should be a bit more careful before insulting
people. Plus, I think the mail was sent to the specific people for this
issue. Would you please tell me who is not &quot;specific&quot; here?
