Yes, please contact me before you do some random stuff.
And please do _not_ pile up patches locally. Send stuff (even incomplete!) to
me for inclusion. There are two reasons for sending stuff very early:
1) You can't break anything. The code won't even be compiled for released kernels.
2) Smaller patches are much easier to review.
3) It's less frustrating for you if I reject a one-day-work-patch instead of a
   three-weeks-work-patch. ;)
4) Sending patches shows to me that you're _seriously_ working on it.
   There are maybe 30 people who contacted me in private and promised working on
   something. Neither of those people did actual work. So my excitation is almost
   zero, if some random guy comes along and promises to work on some stuff.
   Showing actual patches will change this and I won't ignore you in future. ;)

While we're at it: Do _not_ contact me in private. Please always CC the list.
There's a high chance that other people have better or quicker answers to your
questions than me. All discussions tend to shift topics and staying on list enables
other people to respond to those questions much better than me.
So don't be surprised if I don't respond to your &quot;Hey I'm new and I want to work on
the driver&quot; mails. Doing a small patch (even a oneliner) will make me respond. But
random blabla won't. :)

So if you happen to implement 5% of function X and don't expect to continue working
on it for the next two days, please send it. I also do it this way (note that there
are some unused functions the compiler complains about...). I work on it and if I run
out of time I send it. I usually don't pile up more than one-day work locally.
This way multiple development efforts synchronize _automatically_ and there's no
huge coordination needed in practice.

But in any case, it would be nice for us to know what particular feature you're working
on, so other developers can focus on other stuff.

Greetings, Michael.
