No. Very latest firmware kind of implements this (It can do 2 BSS).
If you're going to implement it, you should probably look at how they did it.
(Basically beacons are pushed via DMA to hardware).

The beacon interrupt is basically always triggered when the firmware is ready
to receive a new beacon. It's a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent accesses
to the template ram. If an update is not required, the driver will disable the
interrupt. But if the driver needs to update the beacon (for example due to
TIM changes), the driver unmasks the interrupt and updates the beacon on interrupt.

So I think the beacon IRQ handling in the firmware is trivial. I could remember
incorrectly, but I think it just raises it every time it's done handling one beacon.

Note that there is some weirdness built in, though. For example if both beacon-valid
flags are set that's a special condition and it does _not_ mean both beacons are valid.
Look at the driver. There are some comments.
