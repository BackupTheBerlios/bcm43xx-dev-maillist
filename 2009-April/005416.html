Practice shows this. It's as simple as that.
Try it, if you don't trust me.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you might pick one of the few 4306 that don't work too well.
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, that could be. I have only 4318 branded as Asus, they are all

</I>
I mostly use linksys products for testing.
But I think I could give the asus card a try, if you say it works better in AP mode.

&gt;<i> I have noticed, however a strange fact with these 4318 based linksys:  
</I>&gt;<i> when I set one of them in AP mode, beaconing is perfect and I can join  
</I>&gt;<i> it from other stations. When I ping the AP from stations I get echo

</I>&gt;<i> all; if I telnet from stations to the AP, e.g., to port 22, 3whs ends  
</I>&gt;<i> but then the TCP session dies. The strange fact is that it seems that  
</I>&gt;<i> there are problems for all the frames whose generation involves a

</I>&gt;<i> cross of the mac80211+b43 layers. If instead, on the AP, I completely  
</I>&gt;<i> bypass the network stack and directly ask b43 to transmit a frame  
</I>&gt;<i> (with a modified b43) the frame is transmitted, at every rate I choose  
</I>&gt;<i> (I choose the rate inside the kernel code, I'm not referring to the  
</I>&gt;<i> rate set by iwconfig).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have some of these flawed 4318?
</I>
I don't think the type of device influences whether packets are dropped
inside of some random kernel subsystem.
