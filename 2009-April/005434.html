That card can be replaced with a BCM43XX version supported by b43, but the
process is not for the faint hearted as it involves removing the old card,
booting the machine into GRUB, then hot-plugging the new card and rewriting the
SPROM. I have done this on my HP dv2815 for two cards - a BCM4312 802.11a/b/g
with PCI ID of 4312 (yours has 4315), and a BCM4311/2.

Your version of the BCM4312 will be supported in the future. In fact, the
reverse engineering for the LP PHY is completed and posted at
<A HREF="http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net.">http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net.</A> The remaining step is to convert those
&quot;specifications&quot; into kernel-quality code. Unfortunately, the only person
working on that task is Michael Buesch, and he has other things to do. If you
have the necessary skills, I'm certain that Michael has some things you could do.
