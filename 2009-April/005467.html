Correct. So you'll get slow traffic for a duration of 100ms.
That's even well below the event recognition borderline of humans, which is about 300ms.
So you won't even notice it. You can only measure it with special benchmark
tools, perhaps.

Then wait for another 100ms, if you can spare that time, and you'll get
the full throughput of your shiny quality connection.

To say it once again. Fallback is really what the name says: A fallback.
It's a fallback for error conditions. So if we already have an error condition
(that is the first attempt failed), we should try our best to get the freaking
frame out there. Our best guess with one-rate-retry is 1M. (For MRR
we'd start with a higher rate before we try 1M, of course).

It simply is a limitation of some devices. But I think it's not that bad.
Throughput may just be worse for the first 1/2second or something like this
after the environment conditions changed, because lots of retransmissions hit.
