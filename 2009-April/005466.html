<PRE>By default, minstrel will adjust the best throughput bit rate every
100ms.  If 48 Mbps should be used for the channel, but for some reason
minstrel selects 54 Mbps at the very beginning of the update interval,
1 Mbps will be always used during that interval as fallback rate.
Even if the bit rate is reduced to 48 Mbps, after the first two
retries fail, 1 Mbps is again used as fallback rate.  Of course, I
know it is caused by the fact that there are only 2 rates for b43 and
this may be the best we can do now.

Yes, packet loss will make trouble for TCP.  But for UDP, we have a
trade-off between the maximum throughput we can get and the overall
packet loss rate.  For video streaming applications, I really don't
want a packet to be sent at 1 Mbps as fallback rate when the channel
quality is not that bad.  Anyway, thank you for the explanations.

Thanks,
-Bo
