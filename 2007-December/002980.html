<PRE>Hello,
I've been subscribed to this group since this april, and I'm here to 
report, that my laptop wireless card works - it is a 4318 as in topic

Now, I know the bcm43xx driver is deprecated, but this is what I've done 
to turn it on and get it going under Ubuntu Gutsy (7.10).

My laptop is an Acer 3023WLMi, and it only has a softswitch for 
wireless; Therefore I used

sudo modprobe bcm43xx bad_frames_preempt=1 // did not want to work 
without this, could not associate/get DHCP address
sudo modprobe acerhk wlan_state=1 autowlan=1 // this is to assume the 
state of wlan hardware and to force it on on load

and added these commands (in this order) to /etc/modules;

I know that the bcm43xx is deprecated, and I won't bother you with 
questions about it; only bad thing I experience now is that the dmesg is 
overfilled with messages stating that authenticate has failed, followed 
by printk telling me that some of them were suppressed;
Don't remember really the exact one (unless somebody is interested), but 
as I said as long as it works, I'm not bothered, I can live with that.

The other thing I experience is a Network Manager issue (I need to enter 
the network name over and over again...) so it is not for this list :)

Anyway, I just wanted to express my joy of using my laptop under Linux 
(thou I write this letter from under Windows ;)) thanks to everybody 
involved in this project :)

Keep up the good work :)
As soon as I will catch up with Ubuntu build system, I'm gonna switch to 
b43 and post my findings (which might not be soon, anyway, as IANAP ;) )

Regards,
Lukasz Sokol
