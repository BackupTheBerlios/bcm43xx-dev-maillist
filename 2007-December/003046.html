Guy... .
I KNOW what the patch above does.
What do you think does the following line?
	err = request_module(&quot;rfkill-input&quot;);
Does it load the &quot;rfkill-input&quot; or the &quot;rfkill&quot; module.
That's the million dollar question. You only have one try.

This patch is NOT about the &quot;rfkill&quot; module. I don't know how
often I have to say that. It is _obvious_.

Let's also quote Larry's sevenths point here, that you referred to
now for the second time:
&quot; (7) If rfkill-input is built as a module, it is not automatically loaded.&quot;

I am not sure how I can make this any more clear.
It does load the &quot;rfkill-input&quot; module from within b43.
It does NOT load &quot;rfkill&quot;
It does NOT load &quot;rfkill-input&quot; BEFORE b43 was loaded.

This patch does exactly ONE thing. It does make sure a LED does blink.
Nothing more.
I signed this patch off. So you can be 100% sure I know what it does.
I do NOT sign off patches for which I don't know what they do.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have complete current userspace as of yesterday's Ubuntu Hardy Heron
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; development archives.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok. I will install a copy of Ubuntu Hardy Heron and check if I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reproduce this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not asking you to do that, this particular bug will be fixed by
</I>&gt;<i> Larry's patch, whether you believe that or not.
</I>
Did you try that?
How can b43 load get fixed by a patch that adds a request_module()
to the b43 module? That is a chicken and egg problem!

&gt;<i> &gt; However the fact that this does not happen on older Ubuntu platforms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and does not happen on Fedora leads to the conclusion that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a bug in Hardy Heron that I am not responsible for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The kernel does not exist in a vacuum. It's the kernel's job to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure it works with properly written userspace. Broken userspace, sure,
</I>&gt;<i> then we can talk about breaking it.
</I>
yes properly written userspace.

&gt;<i> &gt; And you also do realise that Hardy Heron is the current development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version of Ubuntu? Development versions have bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oy vay. I'm not an idiot. Yes, it's the current develoment version.
</I>&gt;<i> But tracking the latest kernel.org kernel has in the past required the
</I>&gt;<i> latest develoment version of the distribution, so I upgrade it as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>
I am running wireless-2.6 on feisty. So the kernel does _not_ require
an update of the distribution.
q.e.d.

&gt;<i> I'm not blaming it on you. I'm merely reporting a fucking
</I>&gt;<i> incompatibility. Read my messages again from the top, and stop taking
</I>&gt;<i> this all so damn personally, will you?
</I>
You are telling me that I don't understand patches that I sign off
and I should not take this personally?
That is challenging.
