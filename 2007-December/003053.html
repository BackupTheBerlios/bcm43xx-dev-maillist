No. On my BCM4311/1, my transfer rate peaked at about 12 Mbs with bcm43xx, but increased to 20 Mbs 
with b43. These tests were done with iperf with a server running running on a second computer 
connected by wire to my router. These rates are for 802.11g. When my interface was locked at 11 Mbs, 
the transfer rate was the expected 5.3-5.5 Mbs with both drivers.

I suspect that mac80211 is doing something that your router does not like. Do you have any chance to 
capture the traffic between your computer and the router by using a second wireless computer running 
kismet or wireshark? A look at the differences between b43 and bcm43xx should show the reason.
