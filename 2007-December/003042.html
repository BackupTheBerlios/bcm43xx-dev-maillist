</I>
In my opinion this all is the work of the distributions and not the
work of the kernel developers. Distributions have to make sure that
everything works after a kernel update. Yes I know that this is difficult
with b43, as the firmware is closed source. But this can be worked
around by explicitely prompting the user when the kernel is updated.
This is all distribution stuff.

What if you want to compile your own kernel? Well, then you are on
your own anyway. You have to track kernel changes anyway.
And I am pretty sure that it really is simple to track kernel changes.
Get your favourite kernel news site. It will tell you the changes
without this magic ReleaseAnnouncement file stuff.
I mean. There are news sites (even not specific ones for the kernel)
that reported the bcm43xx-&gt;b43 change weeks ago. There must be some
place where they get this information from without magic files. ;)
