I see no reason for b43 to break, if the firmware is properly installed.
In fact, almost all installation related bugreports we receive are
caused by missing or incorrectly installed firmware.
I would really _like_ to make installing firmware easier or make the
whole need for it vanish, but I simply can not at this point.
But anyway, installing it is not rocket science, either. The only thing
you have to know is where your distribution stores the firmware image files.
If you know that it's a matter of invoking one b43-fwcutter command
to install it. This process can be automated in the distribution's rpm
or deb package scripts.

b43lagacy/ssb is completely featured with module autoload support.
So if you have firmware installed it will automatically load all required
modules and create the network device(s) for it without any user interaction.

If that doesn't work, then stupid distributions are shipping braindamaged
udev scripts that pin a mac address to a specific driver name (see another
mail in this thread). I can _not_ fix this from within the kernel and
I will absolutely shift all responsibility and blame for this to the
maintainers of the distribution's udev scripts.
That's not a b43 specific problem then. Other drivers do break with these
scripts, too.
