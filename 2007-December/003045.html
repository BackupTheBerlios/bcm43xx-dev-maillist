I'm sorry. The patch that _you_ quoted fixes a blinking LED
and nothing else. It does _not_ fix loading of rfkill or b43 in any way.
It does, however, fix loading of rfkill-input. But the b43 module
operation does _not_ depend in any way on the rfkill-input module, except
the tiny LED that doesn't blink if it's not loaded.
I hope you understood now that the thread on bcm43xx-dev was NOT about
your requirement to load rfkill before b43.

&gt;<i> I have complete current userspace as of yesterday's Ubuntu Hardy Heron
</I>&gt;<i> development archives.

Ok. I will install a copy of Ubuntu Hardy Heron and check if I can
reproduce this.
However the fact that this does not happen on older Ubuntu platforms
and does not happen on Fedora leads to the conclusion that it
is a bug in Hardy Heron that I am not responsible for.

And you also do realise that Hardy Heron is the current development
version of Ubuntu? Development versions have bugs.

&gt;<i> One last thing. I've been nice to you. Please be nice to me.
</I>
If you simply stop blaming bugs on me that I am not responsible for
at all, that is a deal. What about filing a bug at the ubuntu bugzilla?

PS:
Note that Ubuntu is known to break the broadcom driver every now and then.
But I can not change that.
