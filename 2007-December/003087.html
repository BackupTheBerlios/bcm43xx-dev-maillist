I hope that you have now convinced yourself that you should be using b43 and not messing around
forcing b43legacy to use a device for which it was not intended. I left that back door in the code
because I wanted to test b43legacy on a computer that could build a kernel in 20 minutes, as
compared to the 12 hours that my old laptop with the device that needs b43legacy. I forgot to clean
up the code as I should have.

You should concentrate on what in your environment changed when you rebooted. If you can get the 200
kBs rate back, please note the noise and signal levels as compared to the values when you are
restricted to 40 kBs.

Is it possible for you to test your laptop on another AP?

Larry
