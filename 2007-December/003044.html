What exactly prevents an old distribution from using new b43
given that they fix their broken udev scripts first?

(I cannot fix their broken scripts from within the kernel.)

Sorry if I didn't chose my wording correctly. But I was only talking
about the development of drivers. It is correct that userspace ABI has
to be preserved, but that is not an issue at all to drivers.
I was talking about things like installing the right firmware for
the new driver. It is the job of the distributors to install the new
firmware when they introduce a new driver. It is the job of the distributors
to test their userland scripts and configuration stuff with that driver
and fix their stuff. It is _not_ my job to fix random distribution
udev scripts or explaining over and over again to people how the firmware
is installed. Either distributions have to install it automatically
or people simply have to read one or two lines of documentation.
That's just what I wanted to say.

Of course it is _my_ job to preserve ABI. I did never want to question that.
