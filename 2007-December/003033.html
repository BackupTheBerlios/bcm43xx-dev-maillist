I dropped maintainance for bcm43xx over a year ago.
So I am not going to catch it up again. b43 works fine.
I don't see a reason to support bcm43xx anymore.
Currently bcm43xx is orphaned, as Larry couldn't support it
anymore due to other issues.

&gt;<i> The testers who did  
</I>&gt;<i> nothing but reported that the new driver did not work on their hardware.
</I>
Which testers?
Ray Lee didn't even install the firmware. So it can't work by definition.
That is not my fault.

&gt;<i> You can write new drivers but you must not break existing users. That's 
</I>&gt;<i> true for every single piece of the kernel. It is _your_ responsibility 
</I>&gt;<i> to get that rule right - and if it does not work out of box (no matter

</I>&gt;<i> from the upstream kernel.
</I>
Ok. So we have to live with an orphaned driver. I am fine with that, too.

&gt;<i> Yes, you can then &quot;unsupport it&quot; in spite and be a prick about it in 
</I>&gt;<i> general but that will only talk of your own personal qualities and will 
</I>&gt;<i> sharply reduce your credibility as a maintainer (and eventually hinder 
</I>&gt;<i> your ability to introduce new code) - users will still have the code 
</I>&gt;<i> available and will have a chance to fix the driver that happens to work. 
</I>&gt;<i> (and perhaps another, capable, but friendler maintainer arises.) And 
</I>&gt;<i> that old code will be a clot to drag around, hindering your 'new' 
</I>&gt;<i> wireless code all along.
</I>
So new code is included in the Linux kernel based only on political
considerations instead on technical?
I'm not sure what's the matter. Show me _one_ person for whom
bcm43xx works and b43/legacy does not. And I will immediately stop
removal of that driver and fix b43.

&gt;<i> I really dont know why it's so hard to understand: new is totally 
</I>&gt;<i> useless if it does not work for old setups 100% of the time. And people 
</I>&gt;<i> _WANT_ to use your new code, so it's not like you have to pull their 
</I>&gt;<i> hairs to get your stuff tested. And YOU wrote the old code in large 
</I>&gt;<i> part:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  $ git-authors drivers/net/wireless/bcm43xx/ | tail -10
</I>&gt;<i>       2  Sam Ravnborg
</I>&gt;<i>       3  David Howells
</I>&gt;<i>       3  David Woodhouse
</I>&gt;<i>       3  Joe Perches
</I>&gt;<i>       4  Jeff Garzik
</I>&gt;<i>       5  Daniel Drake
</I>&gt;<i>       6  Stefano Brivio
</I>&gt;<i>       9  John W. Linville
</I>&gt;<i>      48  Larry Finger
</I>&gt;<i>      80  Michael Buesch
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so it's not like &quot;someone else messed it up&quot; and that you would be 
</I>&gt;<i> incapable of getting it all work nicely and make the migration of users 
</I>&gt;<i> smoother. And if udev is a hindrance to you, reduce your driver's 
</I>&gt;<i> dependence on udev breakages.
</I>
I'm not sure what you are talking about.
If udev renames the device to something stupid (like wlan0_rename)
that is not my fault. That is the fault of a big Linux Distribution
messing udev config up.

Let's summarise it:
I don't know a single user for whom bcm43xx works but b43 does not.
In most cases b43 does work a _lot_ better than bcm43xx.
If you show me one person for whom bcm43xx works but b43 does not I
will stop removal of the driver.
