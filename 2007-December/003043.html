That is a bug in your distribution. I cannot fix this.
Maybe the module is blacklisted or whatever. This is _not_ a b43 bug.

&gt;<i> &gt; This all works perfectly well on all of my systems. And I never heared
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such a problem before.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to blame this on you being tired or something, okay? But in
</I>&gt;<i> the meantime, could you *PLEASE* start giving me the benefit of the
</I>&gt;<i> doubt?
</I>
The message you quote describes a _completely_ unrelated bug.
Besides that the bug described in the message does _not_ prevent
the device from working. It does _just_ prevent some random LED from
blinking. I'd not call that a big issue.
To say it again: This message was about loading &quot;rfkill-input&quot; _after_
b43 was loaded successfully.

Please carefully read the messages before using them to prove me wrong.

&gt;<i> &gt; If you have a PCI device probing works as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The PCI table is in ssb. So as soon as your kernel detects the PCI device
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it will load ssb. ssb will register the PCI device. That will trigger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an udev event for the contained 802.11 core to get probed. This will load
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b43.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, I'm not sure where's the issue with my code here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a patch from Larry Finger to address this and other issues. It
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't made it's way fully upstream yet. Please read your message
</I>&gt;<i> here, in particular item number seven on Larry's list:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2007-December/006472.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2007-December/006472.html</A>
</I>
1) I sent this patch out today for inclusion in the kernel
2) This is a _completely_ unrelated issue.
   It is about &quot;rfkill-input&quot; being not loaded. NOT about
   &quot;b43&quot; or &quot;rfkill&quot; not being loaded.

&gt;<i> &gt; If you do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modprobe b43
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it will automatically load _all_ required modules.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It works perfectly well on my systems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Try it. Simply type &quot;modprobe b43&quot;. It will also work for you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I've said multiple times earlier in this thread, I did try that and
</I>&gt;<i> it didn't work. Do you believe me now?
</I>
Ok, Please find out why it doesn't work.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Heeeeellooooo? I tried that. It failed. What *I'm* talking about here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is that this everyone needs to be aware that this is *not* a drop in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; replacement for bcm43xx, and if I'm having problems (not a kernel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hacker, but I make my living writing code), then sheesh, you're gonna
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have a flood of people needing hand-holding on this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All problems so far were not related to the b43 sourcecode at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And I think I can not be held responsible for unrelated code or bugs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the operating system scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, do you want a scorecard on this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One problem related to b43 source code, patch exists, has yet to be
</I>&gt;<i> merged upstream.
</I>
Yeah. A problem preventing a LED from blinking.
That's a real regression.... Come on. Stop that bullshit.

&gt;<i> One problem related to udev rules, that may or may not be fixed in the
</I>&gt;<i> latest udev. I have udev version 113, which is the latest shipped in
</I>&gt;<i> Ubuntu's nightly development snapshots (hardy heron). I see that
</I>&gt;<i> version 117 of udev is available on kernel.org, but mine is from the
</I>&gt;<i> end of June. One would think that wouldn't be so old as to be a
</I>&gt;<i> complete deal breaker. Especially as bcm43xx works fine with my udev.
</I>
How can I fix that?

&gt;<i> With udev rules hand-edited to include the ATTRS{type}==1 Larry
</I>&gt;<i> pointed out (thanks Larry), b43 also seems to create an odd extra
</I>&gt;<i> device, wmaster0.
</I>
That's not b43 specific. And it is not a bug. Ignore wmaster.
It is not useful for anything from userspace.

&gt;<i> Same MAC as eth1, my wireless. It's just an odd 
</I>&gt;<i> thing that wasn't there before with bcm43xx. May be good, may be bad,
</I>&gt;<i> dunno.
</I>
Blame your distribution, please.

&gt;<i> And yeah, in my opinion, making the kernel play well with up-to-date
</I>&gt;<i> userspace actually *is* part of your job, but then again, what do I
</I>&gt;<i> know.
</I>
How the hell do I workaround broken udev scripts from within the kernel?

&gt;<i> Michael, you're a good guy, I believe that. You're doing unglamorous
</I>&gt;<i> and mostly thankless work, and I am thankful for it. I'm afraid the
</I>&gt;<i> only way I could make it glamorous is to offer to send you a fancy
</I>&gt;<i> feathered outfit to wear while coding :-). But try to meet us testers
</I>&gt;<i> halfway, okay? Please keep in mind that I'm really only trying to
</I>&gt;<i> help.
</I>
Yeah. So PLEASE point out real bugs in MY code and do not bother
me with other peoples bugs that I simply can not fix.
In the list above there was exactly one bug for which I am responsible.
And I already sent a fix for this one.

&gt;<i> Now I'm going to go off, sit in the sun, sip some coffee, and think
</I>&gt;<i> happy thoughts of kittens playing with yarn for a while.
</I>
Have fun.

Greetings Michael.
