<PRE>Larry, I know I am waking up an old thread, but I have a development I
thought was interesting and I need some guidance.

This device:

03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation Dell Wireless 1390
WLAN Mini-PCI Card (rev 01)

quit showing up in fedora 7 and never appeared in fedora 8, however, I
just installed opensuse 10.3 on the second drive and it
has reappeared.

I did the standard update after the initial install and it disappeared again.

The original kernel was replaced by this one,

2.6.22.13-0.3-default

This is what I am thinking, I am going to cp the
/lib/modules/2.6.22.13-0.3-default to a safe location and then do a
scratch install
of opensuse 10.3 and maybe compare the kernels and their modules.  Is
this possible and would it yield the reason why this device
exists under one kernel and not another?

Shoudl I be talking to the kernel devel list or maybe opensuse devel list?

It seems that nothing is physically wrong with the machine if one
kernel sees the device and not another.

Also, just a side note, I did an install of vista to factory state and
as soon as the nvidia430 updates were applied the radio light went
off.

Any thoughts.
