<PRE>Hi Johannes,

I'm currently involved in a project that requires to change a few mac  
timings and other stuff: this is the reason I'm very interested in  
decoding the Broadcom firmware, it could be a good development  
platform without having to buy code and sign NDAs.

I spent a couple of day trying to collect all documents about what  
Broadcom has acquired before 1999 and that could have been  
implemented into AirForce Mac Processors. I didn't find anything that  
was explicitly saying &quot;we are using this core&quot;. I have now a few  
conjectures about the library used to build the chip, let's say a few  
candidate:

- E14 firepath
- Trimedia CPU64
- A kind of ARM core mixed with a FPGA lib

I discovered some patents talking about wifi network and the CPUs of  
above. Do you have any idea?

I also discovered this url <A HREF="http://www.arm.com/iqonline/news/">http://www.arm.com/iqonline/news/</A> 
partnernews/15399.html check it out for future drivers.

And I would very be pleased to know how did you pointed out the  
meaning of the opcode in the website.

Thank you very much for your time,
cheers,
FG
