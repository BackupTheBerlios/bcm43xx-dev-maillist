<PRE>We worked out the SPROM is the same... but here are some interesting twists.

When switched off
1. The LED is switched off by hardware, not b43
2. B43 does send the event as expected but the LED is already off

When switch on
1. The LED is not switched on by hardware
2. B43 does send the event as expected but the LED does not turn on

When the code to pop the LED is triggered more often as in
When I changed in rfkill.c
if (unlikely(report_change)) {

to
if (!unlikely(report_change)) {

Then the LED came on and off every two seconds or so until I set the 
switch to OFF at which point the LED stayed off but the events kept 
happening.  (I put debug messages before and after also spitting out 
poll_dev-&gt;input to check its value for corruption.  It was all good).

I can manually trigger the event (on or off) using setkeycodes, so I suspect
a possible DELAY of the LED coming on after a B43 enable event... for 
hardware that needs it... would fix it.

Thoughts?
