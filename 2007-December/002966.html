<PRE>Hi Johannes,

I read the interesting note you wrote on September about r4 ucode  
reverse engineering. Have you new results since then? Did you  
understand what kind of core is bcm4318 based on? From broadcom  
website it should be a MIPS32 core (check <A HREF="http://www.broadcom.com/">http://www.broadcom.com/</A> 
products/Wireless-LAN/802.11-Wireless-LAN-Solutions they say that  
&quot;The AirForce family of network processors features MIPS32  
processor...(cut)&quot;). It's interesting that you found out a 6 bit  
prefix, like in MIPS!

Before reading your post I came to these conclusions

- all odd words begins with zero (or a couple of them, this depends  
on the firmware version). This led me to think to 8 byte wide  
instructions. Unfortunately both mips32 and mips64 use 32bit wide  
instructions. No mips?
- odd words are control codes to check even words correctness during  
firmware upload: unfortunately there are a lot of even words repeated  
throughout the code with different paired odd words. Did you try to  
change randomly some values and see what happens?
- disassembling the code after having cut out odd words leads to MIPS  
assembly without ret instructions. There is no code too to handle IRQ.

I also tried to change endianness but didn't find anything more  
interesting.

By the way, do you think that a complete reverse engineering could  
give us a platform to test new MAC methodologies? E.g. do you think  
it would be possible to change timings or medium control?

Cheers,
FG
