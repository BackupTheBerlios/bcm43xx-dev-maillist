</I>That came straight out of phy.c.  I was looking for a method of doing a 
wait consistent with the rest of the code.

&gt;<i> Note that this function call is _not_ triggered by pressing the button.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Ok.  I do know that without the wait the function IS called, but the LED 
does not turn on. 
&gt;<i> Is it possible that we have some race condition in software somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> instead?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I can't see how.  When I put debug messages in,  I can see the KEY_WLAN 
going out and I've verified the pointer hasn't changed, but the LED does 
not turn on.  The same sequence one second (or later) works every time 
and the LED goes on or off at will.

If I manually turn the LED on (with the keyboard sequence for KEY_WLAN), 
rfkill will turn the LED off when I turn the radio off consistently but 
without the wait will never turn the LED back on.

If I try the keyboard sequence while the radio is off the LED will not 
come on... leading me to suspect the hardware is preventing it from 
coming on, not anything in the software.


BTW &quot;I can't see how.&quot; also means &quot;I don't know the code.&quot;
