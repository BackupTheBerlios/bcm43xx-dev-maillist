So you volunteer to maintain bcm43xx? Fine. Thanks a lot.

I'm pretty sure it is.
Please carefully read the instructions on
<A HREF="http://www.linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43">http://www.linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43</A>
especially for firmware installation.
It will work very well.
