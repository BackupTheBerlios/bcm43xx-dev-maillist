Oops. My apologies. I have completely missed this fact, and my card is
indeed rev.9 (how was I supposed to know that, anyway? I fail to find
it on openfwwf site). I'll be happy to test openfwwf again when it's
ready for rev.9.

I have tested b43 from 2.6.30 with 4.150 firmware today, and it seems
to be fine (it was not this good with older kernels, I swear!): there
have not been any apparent problems when testing with iperf, but there
still are occasional disassociations with reason 2 when downloading
via ftp for a long time. In wireshark on bcm4318 I see that driver
sends one probe after 2-seconds silence (no rx _and_ tx), and then
sends deauthentication packet with reason 2 in params after two more
seconds. The kernel log reads:

... multiple PHY error messages ...

disassociating

Strangely, iw event does not register deauth packet.

If I re-assign ESSID (without changing it, just iwconfig wlan0 essid
XXX), the card reassociates, and ftp transfer continues. Why does
automatic reassociation not work in this case? Why there was only one
probe? What might be the reason for 'b43-phy6 debug: Wireless
interface stopped'?

And to answer Michael's question about iperf on openfwwf:

&gt;<i> What does iperf in UDP mode show? Does it also show these bursts?
</I>No, the throughput is quite stable (unstable for tcp). With 4.150
firmware, throughput is also stable for both udp and tcp.

Thanks.
