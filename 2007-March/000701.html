</I>
No, I was testing the upload speed to the server. My experience is that the cards have always been
able to receive better than transmit. Iperf has two switches that are supposed to handle
bi-directional testing, but I have not yet made either of them work.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm surprised that amplitude of signal does not correlate with performance; however, the 4311

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at that rate. In addition, the 4306 showed a much poorer separation of the individual subchannels in

</I>&gt;<i> I think these are probably related. If you are indeed doing downstream

It is likely a combination of better hardware and more stuff done in firmware, which isn't bothered
by the mistakes in the driver. With that ancient pre-g 4306, the quantities known as rotor and
retard, which I suspect to be involved in the OFDM subchannel encoding, need to be loaded. Later
revisions of the PHY have these built in.

&gt;<i> I think it could be quite interesting to run the tests the other way as
</I>&gt;<i> upstream tests.
</I>
I will do the reverse tests soon.
