<PRE>Hi all!

I've been running the bcm43xx driver on a bcm4311 for a few weeks now.
I'm using kubuntu, and have a homebaked 2.6.20 vanilla kernel with Larrys 
combined_2.6.20.patch. My laptop is a HP dv2140eu.

I've experienced a few oddities that follow.

When returning from acpi sleep the computer often feezes. My solution is to 
run &quot;modprobe -r bcm32xx&quot; before suspend and then &quot;modprobe bcm43xx&quot; manually 
after resume. I can not do this in a script as this will hang the computer. 
Even if it's set as the last script.

After modprobing the driver I need to run some iwconfig commands on the 
interface to bring it up. &quot;iwconfig eth1 essid off&quot; is sufficient. But it 
won't work until a few seconds after the driver is loaded. If I don't issue 
any iwconfig commands the device will never associate.

I have burnt a few dvd-rw's over the network and the sustained speed is 
between 200-800kbyte regardless of rate. The thing is that after a while the 
throughput becomes zero and won't come back unless I unload and reload the 
driver again. With higher rates I get higher spikes, but overall it is the 
same throughput and the connection is more stable at 11 and 12M than 18 and 
24. Anything above is very unstable.

Note that I have no previous experience of wireless devices in linux, nor 
suspend/hibernate.

Without your work and dedication I would never be able to run linux on this 
machine, so thank you for your effort and great work!

Btw, do you take (monetary) donations, and if so, how is it spent?

</PRE>
