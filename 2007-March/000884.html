On i386 we are fine, as long as we don't use scatter-gather IO for the
DMA operations. If we kmalloc() the DMA buffers, we are implicitely
guaranteed (as long as nobody changed the user/kernel split) to be
under the 1G barrier (actually the barrier is at 1G minus 128M).

Although, people want to implement SG-IO for mac80211. That
would mean buffers are not copied to kernelspace, so they could
be above 1G.

&gt;<i> but I know that the x86_64 
</I>&gt;<i> architecture was forced to produce the same (wrong) results as were obtained in the i386-specific
</I>&gt;<i> code. I agree that it should be fixed; however, it will never happen.
</I>
Explain why, please. I'm very interrested in knowing why this
is so fucking broken and why nobody fixes it. ;)

&gt;<i> As a result, every driver for 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware with less than 32-bit DMA addressing has to address (pun intended) the problem. We will
</I>&gt;<i> probably be fighting the problem again when &gt; 4 GB RAM computers become common and 32 bits are not
</I>&gt;<i> enough to address all of memory.
</I>
Nope, see Johannes' mail.
