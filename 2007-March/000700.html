<PRE>Hi,

Great update, thanks! Good to hear that you got that laptop working.

&gt;<i> Performance testing is accomplished using Iperf with the server connected to my Linksys WRT54G V5
</I>&gt;<i> AP/router via a 100 BaseTX wired connection. If I boot Windows XP and run Iperf from it, I get 19.5
</I>&gt;<i> Mbs reported. As the Iperf results show considerable jitter, I always run at least 5 trials and
</I>&gt;<i> report the maximum. The distance from my test computer to the AP is approximately 2m. All bcm43xx
</I>&gt;<i> tests were done with the latest patches applied.
</I>
The iperf tests you're running are downstream tests, right? I mean,
you're doing downloads from that server to the machine with the cards.

&gt;<i> I'm surprised that amplitude of signal does not correlate with performance; however, the 4311
</I>&gt;<i> amplitude does diminish a lot at the 48 Mbs rate, which probably explains the falloff in performance
</I>&gt;<i> at that rate. In addition, the 4306 showed a much poorer separation of the individual subchannels in
</I>&gt;<i> the spectrum.
</I>
I think these are probably related. If you are indeed doing downstream
tests (I guess so) then all this means is that now we've reached a power
level where the 4318 can successfully ack frames (which would previously
lead to retransmissions and timeouts of packets etc). I'd think that at
that point the transmission characteristics become less important than
the reception characteristics. I suppose that we need to work on those
for the 4306, but most likely newer chips also just have better
characteristics due to hardware improvements.

I think it could be quite interesting to run the tests the other way as
upstream tests.
