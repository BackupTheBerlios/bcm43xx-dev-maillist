<PRE>Since those changes are in the fedora-netdev repo, I downloaded that 
kernel* and performance jumped to over 7Mbps to outside testing places.
Wow!  Nice job guys!

Thanks for the advice, Larry, and thanks for the hard work from the 
development and spec teams!

Ehud

*ok, it wasn't quite that simple because I have an Nvidia video card.
First I downloaded kernel 2.6.20-1.2933.4.4.netdev.8.fc6, which replaced 
my 2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 (from fedora-updates repo).
No more usable video because of the Nvidia kernel module, but I could 
verify that bcm43xx worked like a charm.
Downloaded the kernel source RPM.  Changed the kernel ID from &quot;-prep&quot; to 
&quot;-1.2933.fc6&quot;, built, installed, and now everything works like a 
charm... the bcm4311 card is running like a rocket... my Nvidia 
proprietary kernel module binary is loading... and life is good.  In 
short, again, THANKS!  I only mention the story so that other people 
tempted to just download the kernel will consider whether they too have 
to put up with vendors who are so shortsighted as to release binary-only 
modules requiring those of us who want to use their product (or have no 
choice, depending on circumstance) with the latest and greatest kernel...
