  |&gt;  If you use a wired connection, what is your rate? How close is
  |&gt;  wireless to saturating your broadband connection?

Very close.  The difference between wired and wireless is barely
appreciable. On a wired connection for the same test (i.e. downloading
the bzipped kernel tarball from a distant host with wget), the
*reported* download rate varies between 613 and 617 KB/sec (it was
590--615 for the Broadcom 4318). The *actual* download time is
somewhat faster with the wired connection---varying between 69sec and
73sec, as opposed to around 90sec for wireless.

Sorry, I'm a complete amateur (as I'm sure you've already made
out). Here are the numbers produced for the LAN by the script that you
attached:

-------
iIwconfig rate set to 6 Mbs
Transmit rate: 4.21 4.15 4.18 4.21 4.14  Mbits/sec
 Receive rate: 16.2 16.2 16.2 16.0 16.2  Mbits/sec

iIwconfig rate set to 9 Mbs
Transmit rate: 6.01 5.97 5.96 5.93 5.96  Mbits/sec
 Receive rate: 16.9 17.0 16.7 16.9 16.4  Mbits/sec

iIwconfig rate set to 11 Mbs
Transmit rate: 6.15 6.15 6.16 6.22 6.14  Mbits/sec
 Receive rate: 13.7 13.4 13.7 13.7 13.6  Mbits/sec

iIwconfig rate set to 18 Mbs
Transmit rate: 9.93 10.1 10.0 9.95 9.92  Mbits/sec
 Receive rate: 17.4 17.5 17.5 17.4 17.4  Mbits/sec

iIwconfig rate set to 24 Mbs
Transmit rate: 11.9 12.0 12.0 12.1 12.0  Mbits/sec
 Receive rate: 17.8 17.7 17.6 17.7 17.6  Mbits/sec

iIwconfig rate set to 36 Mbs
Transmit rate: 15.0 15.1 15.0 14.9 14.9  Mbits/sec
 Receive rate: 17.9 17.8 17.9 17.8 17.7  Mbits/sec

iIwconfig rate set to 48 Mbs
Transmit rate: 17.0 17.1 17.1 17.0 17.1  Mbits/sec
 Receive rate: 17.8 18.1 17.9 17.9 17.9  Mbits/sec

Iwconfig rate reset to 24 Mbs

Damn good, I'd say. The AP is conected to the server by way of a
standard wired connection (the ethernet controller on the server is a
Broadcom BCM4401 100Base-T, with the b44 driver from 2.6.18).

  |&gt;  There is one patch that may help that is not in 2.6.21-rc4 - it
  |&gt;  does help my system at 48 Mbs. It is also attached.

Thank you. I will try this after I've had a little sleep, but it
doesn't look to me like the setup here needs a lot of help at 48 Mbs.

This card is now working much better than the other two wireless cards I
have, as long as I stay within 7 metres or so of the access point.

Good night,

Jim
