Your question didn't make it seem that you really understood.

AFAIK, the openWRT project uses pre-compiled binary drivers for the bcm43xx device from the Linksys
GPL'd source distribution, which is also the piece of code that was decompiled in our
reverse-engineering step. We could use it as well, but we would be limited to 2.4 kernels, have to
run MIPS hardware, and would have tainted kernels.
