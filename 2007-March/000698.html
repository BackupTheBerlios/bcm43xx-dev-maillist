Uhm, well. Yeah. For the first we could restrict it to embedded-only devices.
And the rest, well. Probably there's some way to find out if
the core works or not, too. I need to look through the register stuff again.

But again, it shouldn't oops like yours at registering the hcd. That seems
like a software bug. It may oops later with a buserror, sure.
