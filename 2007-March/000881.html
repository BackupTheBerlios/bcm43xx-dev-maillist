To me that would mean honoring the dma_mask for _ALL_ DMA memory allocations. I have not followed
all the arguments as to why this was never fixed in the i386 code, but I know that the x86_64
architecture was forced to produce the same (wrong) results as were obtained in the i386-specific
code. I agree that it should be fixed; however, it will never happen. As a result, every driver for
hardware with less than 32-bit DMA addressing has to address (pun intended) the problem. We will
probably be fighting the problem again when &gt; 4 GB RAM computers become common and 32 bits are not
enough to address all of memory.
