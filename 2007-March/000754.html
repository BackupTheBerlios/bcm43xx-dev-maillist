One user has had trouble connecting to Cisco AP's with hidden ESSIDs. Before this, I had not gotten
any report of success in associating with a hidden ESSID and thought the problem was general.
Perhaps that is not the case. In the dumpfile that you sent me, the Netgear AP is broadcasting a
NULL ESSID every 100 msec. This is obviously a different AP than the one discussed above.

With regard to getting a DHCP address, there should not be any bcm43xx-specific problems, as long as
reliable communications are established. There may be problems with certain AP's. For example, there
was a recent &quot;upgrade&quot; to the firmware of Linksys WRT54G V5/6 units that killed DHCP connections to
all Linux and OS X clients. It didn't matter whether the connection was wired or wireless. Only
Windows clients worked, which gives you some idea of the depth of their testing! I filed a bug
report and had to revert to the previous firmware version. It was fixed within a week, or so.

To test the reliability of your connection, I suggest using the Iperf utility with some other host
on your LAN as the server and your computer as the client. For bi-directional tests, use the 'iperf
-c &lt;server&gt; -r' command. If the speed obtained by this test is 5 Mbs or higher, then your connection
is reliable. If the above test works, I can suggest is that you post your AP make, model, and
firmware level and ask if anyone else is using that unit.
