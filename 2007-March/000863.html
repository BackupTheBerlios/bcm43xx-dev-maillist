I mean, I want to test the latest bcm43xx to see is the &quot;machine check
is gone&quot;.

It's quite common for somebody to wish to download, compile and install
the driver without the hassle of patching the kernel, especially a
vendor kernel or an embedded kernel that's hard upgrade, or a kernel
that takes hours to compile.

For a quickly progressing driver, having a standalone distribution could
be very convenient for both users and developers.  Users of exotic
processors could catch the bugs x86 hides.

</I>&gt;<i> the in-tree mac80211 version?
</I>
I would say the softmac version should stay in the tree.  Firstly, it
supports older hardware.  Secondly, it's a point of reference, which is
useful until the driver is quite stable.

But most importantly, bcm43xx_mac80211 has some issues that bcm43xx
doesn't have.  I have to disable 802.11g modes just to use it.  I'm not
sure if it's related, but bcm43xx_mac80211 emits this warning on
startup:

bcm43xx_mac80211: !WARNING! Idle-TSSI phy-&gt;cur_idle_tssi measuring
failed. (cur=9, tgt=62). Disabling TX power adjustment.

I'm not really an expert here, but it looks like a very hard problem to
me.  I just don't see any practical approach to fixing it.  I don't
think it can be assumed that it will just go away.

Having a mac80211 driver with v3 firmware would be a first step at
bisecting the bug, but I guess it would be very time consuming.  On the
other hand, it could replace the softmac driver eventually.
