Well, I'd start by showing the main developers how to reproduce it :)

If you can test it at a time the network is otherwise fairly idle, and
just bring your bcm43xx up with 'ip link set eth1 up' rather than
assigning it a Legacy IP address, then there should be _very_ little
traffic -- but it _should_ do router discovery and pick up an IPv6
address. Use tcpdump at both ends, and compare the results. I have a
very strong suspicion that you'll find there are multicast Ethernet
packets getting lost in transit.

&gt;<i> is there a way to use radvd to talk to the other radvd - which i asked

</I>
No. radvd only advertises routes for a single subnet. It advertises the
'prefix' -- the upper 64 bits -- and the lower 64 bits are generated by
the individual station, from a permutation of that station's MAC
address. The station assumes the default route is out via the machine
which was running radvd.

If you want to run radvd with a 'real' global address and provide proper
connectivity, then you have to have a subnet of your own for radvd to
advertise. With '6to4' that's actually dead easy -- you get a whole /48
of IPv6 addresses for every public IPv4 address, which means 65536
separate /64 subnets of your own. It's better to get 'proper' IPv6
connectivity though, if you can -- either through a tunnel such as from
somewhere like sixxs.net, or just ask the university to assign you some
space and tunnel it to you.
