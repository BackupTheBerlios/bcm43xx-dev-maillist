There are some problems with bcm43xx in a crowded environment; however, I think your problems are 
with signal strength. The iwconfig log shows only very low signal levels. I see that you are using 
2.6.21. Have you patched bcm43xx? If not, that will help some. In addition, your school has designed 
your networks badly. Channels 9 and 13 interfere with each other. If they are going to put all their 
AP's on only 2 channels, they should use 8 and 13.
