<PRE>2007/5/9, Larry Finger &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">larry.finger at lwfinger.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> There are some problems with bcm43xx in a crowded environment; however, I think your problems are
</I>&gt;<i> with signal strength. The iwconfig log shows only very low signal levels. I see that you are using
</I>&gt;<i> 2.6.21. Have you patched bcm43xx? If not, that will help some. In addition, your school has designed
</I>&gt;<i> your networks badly. Channels 9 and 13 interfere with each other. If they are going to put all their
</I>&gt;<i> AP's on only 2 channels, they should use 8 and 13.
</I>
Unfortunately channels of APs didn't change.

I tested this network again, using 2.6.22-rc2-git7-20-default and I
was not able to connect. I made a small log of /var/log/messages,
maybe it contains some usefully info?

Ah, and one more fact. I think I have some problems with iwlist now:


acer:/home/zajec # iwlist scan
lo        Interface doesn't support scanning.

irda0     Interface doesn't support scanning.

eth0      Interface doesn't support scanning.

Warning: Driver for device wlan0 has been compiled with version 22
of Wireless Extension, while this program supports up to version 21.
Some things may be broken...

wlan0     Scan completed :


But on the other hand I can connect to network in 3 not crowded env
without problems...
