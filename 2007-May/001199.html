I'm afraid you are wrong about it.  In fact, the softmac based driver is
supporting rates up to 54 Mbps, although 48 and 54 Mbps rates are not
working well.  24 Mbps is working really well for me.  There is no speed
limitation in softmac.  The limitations are hardware specific.

The mac80211 based driver has some issues with power calibration, so it
works better if the rate is limited.  Larry posted a patch recently that
makes the rate start at 1 Mbps and then go up if the connection is good.
That helps a lot.

</I>&gt;<i> how? I've researched the matter, but haven't figured it out.

Yes, the module is present in the wireless-dev git repository.  It's not
yet in any released version of Linux.  I think it may go to 2.6.22, but
I'm not sure.  It's entirely possible that only those drivers will be
submitted that are more stable and offer support to the hardware not
supported otherwise.

We'll find out very soon, when Linux 2.6.22-rc1 is released.
