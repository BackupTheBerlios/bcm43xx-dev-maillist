<PRE>Hey Arne,

Just a few things about running opensuse 10.2. Suse's tapping recognition
has been excellent on every single laptop I've tried in on, so not quite
sure why you'd need extra code for it. The default kernel is obsolete and
like Larry says, &gt; 2.6.21 is where the good stuff is at. My advice would be
to update the kernel right away... that might fix the lack of sound. Here's
the factory kernel repo:
<A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Kernel:/HEAD/openSUSE_Factory(this">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Kernel:/HEAD/openSUSE_Factory(this</A>
is in development and constantly updated, but I'm using it in
10.3 and haven't had any issues with the current version at least). If that
doesn't help, you might want to check Yast / Hardware / Sound to see what's
going on there.

The nvidia driver is best downloaded from nvidia's website (there may be a
current official repo, but I don't know since I'm stuck with ATI).
Installation is very straightforward and pretty much a breeze. You probably
won't be able to get the bcm43xx driver working with your wireless card, but
if you really want to give it a good shot, fwcutter is in the net install
repo:
<A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/SL-OSS-factory/inst-source/suseand">http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/SL-OSS-factory/inst-source/suseand</A>
you can get the firmware off the net if you don't already have it. You
can always check Yast / Network Devices / Network Card to see what suse is
doing with your network cards. As Gene said, your best bet to get that
particular card working is probably to use ndiswrapper. Goodluck.
