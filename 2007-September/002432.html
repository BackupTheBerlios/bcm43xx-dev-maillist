<PRE>Hi,

I have a linksys WPC54GS pcmcia wifi card.  lspci details below.  I tried
it with the latest firmware and Ubuntu gutsy's 2.6.22-10-generic and
2.6.22-11-generic kernels.  With the former, I got WPA working
intermittently, but not stably (ie it'd die and need the driver reloading).
With the latter, I could only get it working unencrypted (I didn't debug in
detail, but it seemed like it didn't associate so presumaby the link never
came up -- I can give logs and more detail if it's useful).

I went onto the IRC channel and noted the suggestion that I try the
wireless-dev tree (2.6.23-rc4).  So I did and I'm glad to say successfully.
I'm using it now and have been for the past 6-8 hours on and off without
any reboot or problems.  I guess it's possible it would also work with the
current 2.6.23-rc6 development kernel.  Perhaps I'll try and check that in
due course.

A couple of things worth mentioning.  

1. I've been getting tonnes of syslog errors like this:
	Sep 16 21:46:59 tilly kernel: [ 5171.869169] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:09:5b:d2:f0:2f
	Sep 16 21:46:59 tilly kernel: [ 5171.872336] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:18:84:11:78:d6
	Sep 16 21:47:05 tilly kernel: [ 5174.178449] printk: 122 messages suppressed.
   which all seem to correspond to packets tranferred between my AP and
   a second netgear laptop with an atheros chipset.  So it's not a worry.
   ifconfig shows a collossal packet drop count, which seems to
   approximately equal the number of packets sent+rec'd  by the other
   laptop so I guess it's the same error as above.  Perhaps there's a good
   debug reason for these printk statements, but they have their cost on the
   machine.

2. The quoted signal strength is 50% even when I have the AP and card right
   next to each other.  It doesn't bother me, but I wonder if it's correct
   or not.

I wrote up a howto for Ubuntu here as I suspect others might be interested
to try it out.
