As far as I can tell, this is a NetworkManager problem. I have two APs, one with WPA and one with
WEP encryption so that I can test in either mode without affecting my wife's connection. With
NetworkManager 0.6.4, I found that if I wanted to switch networks, I had to &quot;try&quot; to connect to a
third network, which could be another encrypted wireless or my wired interface. Once that was done,
then I could connect to the other wireless network. Now I have upgraded to NM 0.6.5 and I can switch
wireless connections directly. I don't know which version of NM is in Gutsy, but I'm willing to bet
that it is 0.6.4.
