</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I think that's not what we want. The real fix is simple. See below.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If you can suggest a reordering of the initialization that delays PHY setup until the &quot;magic step&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; unable to find such a solution.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is no reordering needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You just need to find out why phy-&gt;gmode was not set.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it's set based on the have_gphy and have_bphy bits.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So you need to look there why one of these is not set. That is the real
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cause of the issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the original code, have_gphy was true, and phy-&gt;gmode was set. These variables were not the cause.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In bcm43xx, the second argument to wireless_core_reset controls the value of phy-&gt;connected at exit.
</I>&gt;<i> This behavior is missing in the original b43legacy (and in b43). For b43, it seems to have no
</I>&gt;<i> consequence, but for the early PHYs, phy-&gt;connected controls when certain registers can be
</I>&gt;<i> read/written and affects the program flow through the phy and radio initialization. The lack of the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to toggle gmode is what leads to the register errors, and this is what my change restores.
</I>&gt;<i> The name could be changed, but that seems more intrusive than necessary.
</I>
No, your patch doesn't restore anything. It rips out the gmode logic.
I just want to make sure you understand what you are actually doing there.
the old phy-&gt;connected semantics were completely broken. Forget about them.
The problem here is, that at some point phy-&gt;gmode is not set, where
it should be set (or the other way around).
So it's not about renaming or something.

With your patch you remove the &quot;gmode&quot; semantics, so you could
as well remove the whole variable and always assume it's set.
But I don't recommend to go that way. I'd suggest you find the
place in the code where phy-&gt;gmode is not set but it should be.
_that_ is the place where the real bug is.

Just want to make sure you understand the consequences of your patch.
You remove a feature with that.
If that feature is really needed in legacy; that is another question.
It's needed if you want to drive APHY devices.
