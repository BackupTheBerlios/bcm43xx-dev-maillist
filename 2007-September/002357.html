</I>&gt;<i>     hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     In my dialog with Larry, I asked:
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Well, just some idea.  Perhaps I could install Suse, replicate your
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; settings and check it ?
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Now, I am running OpenSuse 10.2, with default x86_86 kernel 2.6.18.2-34.
</I>&gt;<i>     I am unfamilar with Suse, and a bit unsure as how to set it up.
</I>&gt;<i>     At the moment it uses a Vesa frame buffer device, and perhaps I should
</I>&gt;<i>     try to compile a NVIDIA driver - any suggestions ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ( did try once, but didn't get it working)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Next, I had to download and install nForceth driver from NVIDIA, as
</I>&gt;<i>     the wire
</I>&gt;<i>     ethernet wouldn't be recognized. Then I have got some code installed
</I>&gt;<i>     to control the &quot;tapping&quot; feature of the touchpad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     As reported earlier, the Fedora update kernels had the machine go crazy.
</I>&gt;<i>     So even with the &quot;tapping enabled&quot; in Suse, the behaviour isn't as
</I>&gt;<i>     wild as
</I>&gt;<i>     it was with Fedora. Perhaps Fedora kernels don't recognize the AMD
</I>&gt;<i>     stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     My confusion have had something to do with the impression that in
</I>&gt;<i>     one particular install - I had wireless up.  I still cannot swear
</I>&gt;<i>     it, I could have been fooled by something it pulled up from the
</I>&gt;<i>     cache, but as I have
</I>&gt;<i>     said - this wasn't my impression. I have been checking pages all
</I>&gt;<i>     over to figure out this thing. In the end I did open this damn
</I>&gt;<i>     thing, to see what this card looked like.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Surprise - the chips says BCM4311KFBG... what the heck ?? Checking
</I>&gt;<i>     data at
</I>&gt;<i>     HP, which says what I have reported earlier. But in the end I found some
</I>&gt;<i>     partlist that seems to operate with two different part numbers, not
</I>&gt;<i>     saying
</I>&gt;<i>     what the chip set might be, but there is 2 and 3 wire antenna versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Checking registry in Vista - reveals Broadcom..and then 4312 ?

</I>&gt;<i>     Larry wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; This is exactly the computer I have. The wireless is a BCM4311.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ( take it that your wireless is working, that there is some driver
</I>&gt;<i>     for it ?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     If so, then what do I need to do ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     As I did mention earlier Larry, your hardware didn't seem that far
</I>&gt;<i>     apart from
</I>&gt;<i>     mine. Perhaps you have some configuration file, what options need to
</I>&gt;<i>     be included in compiling a kernel ?  ( There are a whole lot of
</I>&gt;<i>     options that
</I>&gt;<i>     I don't have a clue what they are for. )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Oh, by the way - in Suse, I have no sound. (HD Audio-Conexant
</I>&gt;<i>     CX20549-12)
</I>&gt;<i>     - according to the info pages from HP. ( did come up in Fedora )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Looking at those specifications from HP again - it does say:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;Broadcom 4321AGN Wi-Fi Adapter (802.11 a/b/g/ draft-n) + Bluetooth
</I>&gt;<i>     w/2      antennas&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     But as I checked inside, Bluetooth is supported by a separate card.
</I>&gt;<i>     ( Broadcom, as far as I know..does have some designs with Bluetooth
</I>&gt;<i>     - but in
</I>&gt;<i>     this case, the blue tooth don't seem to have any relation to Broadcom )
</I>&gt;<i>     Also.. using the Serial number, service number, or any number - will
</I>&gt;<i>     lead
</I>&gt;<i>     you to this info from HP, - so at least I was made to believe the
</I>&gt;<i>     info was
</I>&gt;<i>     correct.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ( Sorry about the length, but - in case someone else got fooled like
</I>&gt;<i>     I have
</I>&gt;<i>     been )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So.. where do I go from here ?
</I>
For the most part, I have stopped answering your posts because you don't seem to understand what I
say, and you ramble without making your thoughts clear. I will, however, tell you how to disable
tapping and make your touchpad more easily usable. You need to apply this patch:

As you can see, this patch is a change in X11, not the openSUSE stuff directly. FWI, I only use the
frame buffer. I cannot be bothered with having to rebuild the binary module for the closed-source
driver. In addition, the tainted kernel would be the kiss of death for me.

I always disable tapping on every laptop I use. Perhaps it is my internal capacitance or some other
characteristic of mine, but I always get extraneous mouse events when tapping is enabled.
