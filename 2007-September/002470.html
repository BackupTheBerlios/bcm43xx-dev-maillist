</I>
The above message is pretty clear. We don't support that 80211 core revision (yet). It will not be
properly supported until our reverse engineers have a chance to find out what special programming is
needed for that device. It may, or may not work. I have no way to predict that.

</I>
You need to get a version 3.x driver to use bcm43xx. The place to get one is listed below.

&gt;<i> These &quot;core up ... failed&quot; messages continue to appear in the log once per 
</I>&gt;<i> second. I suspect the message about version 4.x drivers not being supported 
</I>&gt;<i> is the problem.
</I>
Only part of the problem, but a killer for sure.

&gt;<i> If I try to bring up the interface manually, I get the error &quot;SIOCSIFFLAGS: 
</I>&gt;<i> Operation not supported&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should I try to find an older driver? Is it likely to work with my newer 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware? 
</I>
Partially.

&gt;<i> I can help try to add support for 4.x drivers if anyone is interested. I am an 
</I>&gt;<i> experienced developer, though not on Linux, and especially not on device 
</I>&gt;<i> drivers. 
</I>
Not needed. In the near future, bcm43xx will be replaced by a driver named b43, which supports V4
firmware.

To get a V3 driver, please go to &quot;<A HREF="http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/wl_apsta-3.130.20.0.o">http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/wl_apsta-3.130.20.0.o</A>&quot;. Grab
that driver, extract the firmware, and see what happens. Send the bcm43xx messages from the new trial.

Larry
