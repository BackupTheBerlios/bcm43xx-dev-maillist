In the original code, have_gphy was true, and phy-&gt;gmode was set. These variables were not the cause.

In bcm43xx, the second argument to wireless_core_reset controls the value of phy-&gt;connected at exit.
This behavior is missing in the original b43legacy (and in b43). For b43, it seems to have no
consequence, but for the early PHYs, phy-&gt;connected controls when certain registers can be
read/written and affects the program flow through the phy and radio initialization. The lack of the
ability to toggle gmode is what leads to the register errors, and this is what my change restores.
The name could be changed, but that seems more intrusive than necessary.
