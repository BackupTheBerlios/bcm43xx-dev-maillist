Well, everything is a bloody pain, and I sure have a ton of questions :(
I have kept on since last night. Didn't get the kernel-sources I downloaded intact, and what is going on at this site - seems too advanced for me. 
Haven't used Suse since version 6, even then not that much. Things have become so different and unfamiliar.

        hi,

        Thanks Nkoli,

        I just downloaded:

        kernel-default-2.6.22.5-265.1.x86_64.rpm
        kernel-syms, and kernel-source.

        One question: there was a kernel-rt    as well  -  is that  a  realtime  kernel  ? 


    Yep, it is, though I can't vouch for it since I never use it.

        ( as unbelieveable it may sound, I did spend years participating in the first real time kernel for Linux.. but I must have lost some braincells since then ;)

</I>&gt;<i>    PS: It sounds like you've spent waaaay too much time on this issue. 
</I>&gt;<i> Setting up a linux box should never take this much effort.. you shouldn't &gt; have to fight with your computer to get it working.

For some reason, this has become a nightmare. Did update packages, the
kernel is 2.6.18-0.5 - but after that it is impossible to get contact with
the wired ethernet again. It will not detect if I plug it in, while if I plug
something in the USB port, it may figure out that the ethercable is there.
Probably need to do another clean install - with all the hazzle that follows.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since everything else is working, (sound on suse notwithstanding), if the &gt; bcm driver in 2.6.22-5 doesn't succeed in getting you a/b/g speeds, save 
</I>&gt;<i> yourself the headache and use ndiswrapper till Larry and co get around to &gt; hacking the N cards. Just my 10 cents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>


Well, this card only supports  a/b/g - it's a 4311 chip - else I had given
up. 


( only mentioned if you check spare part numbers. Think there is 4 different cards depending on country, etc. )

It comes with both Intel and AMD, with different bridge-chips, and that may
be part of the trouble.
