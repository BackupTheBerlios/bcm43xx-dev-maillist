<PRE>Hello,

If I just need to buy a new card just let me know. The card does NOT
work in Window any more. But I'm curious.

I have a Broadcom card that reports itself as the 14e4:4320, 4320
which I understand to mean 4306. In the past I successfully used this
card under Linux using both ndiswrapper and the bcm43xx driver. I
would assume it worked under Windows then as well, I never tried until
now when it does not work under ndiswrapper, bcm43xx or Windows.

I had a hard drive failure which required opening up the computer and
it's possible the hard drive failed due to humidity (The computer was
left by an open window during a rain storm while it was on. However
the computer stayed on that whole time and was shut down normally. It
was a few days later when I tried to turn it on that the hard drive
stopped working). Perhaps this is related to the card failure as well,
or perhaps static discharge while I was inside the notebook.


Using the BCM43xx driver I initially get the &quot;Could not determine Chip
ID&quot; error. Manually overriding the chip_id to be 0x4306 gets past that
error, but then it fails to read core #2. The first two cores look
wrong as well (Core 0 is reported as ID 0x34 Rev 0x51 vendor 0x314e).

Finally I outputted the value of sb_id_hi and it appears to be 0xFFFFFFFF.

So perhaps I should just buy a new card. But perhaps I could hack the
driver to work enough to dump the ssb_sprom and then see if that could
be repaired?

Thanks for the help. And thanks for the excellent driver.

</PRE>
