</I>&gt;<i>  hi,

</I>&gt;<i> In my dialog with Larry, I asked:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, just some idea.  Perhaps I could install Suse, replicate your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; settings and check it ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I am running OpenSuse 10.2, with default x86_86 kernel 2.6.18.2-34.
</I>&gt;<i> I am unfamilar with Suse, and a bit unsure as how to set it up.
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment it uses a Vesa frame buffer device, and perhaps I should
</I>&gt;<i> try to compile a NVIDIA driver - any suggestions ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ( did try once, but didn't get it working)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next, I had to download and install nForceth driver from NVIDIA, as the wire
</I>&gt;<i> ethernet wouldn't be recognized. Then I have got some code installed to
</I>&gt;<i> control the &quot;tapping&quot; feature of the touchpad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As reported earlier, the Fedora update kernels had the machine go crazy.
</I>&gt;<i> So even with the &quot;tapping enabled&quot; in Suse, the behaviour isn't as wild as
</I>&gt;<i> it was with Fedora. Perhaps Fedora kernels don't recognize the AMD stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My confusion have had something to do with the impression that in one
</I>&gt;<i> particular install - I had wireless up.  I still cannot swear it, I could
</I>&gt;<i> have been fooled by something it pulled up from the cache, but as I have
</I>&gt;<i> said - this wasn't my impression. I have been checking pages all over to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out this thing. In the end I did open this damn thing, to see what
</I>&gt;<i> this card looked like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Surprise - the chips says BCM4311KFBG... what the heck ?? Checking data at
</I>&gt;<i> HP, which says what I have reported earlier. But in the end I found some
</I>&gt;<i> partlist that seems to operate with two different part numbers, not saying
</I>&gt;<i> what the chip set might be, but there is 2 and 3 wire antenna versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Checking registry in Vista - reveals Broadcom..and then 4312 ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Larry wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is exactly the computer I have. The wireless is a BCM4311.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ( take it that your wireless is working, that there is some driver for it ?)
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at those specifications from HP again - it does say:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Broadcom 4321AGN Wi-Fi Adapter (802.11 a/b/g/ draft-n) + Bluetooth w/2
</I>&gt;<i> antennas&quot;
</I>
As was said before there are no supported Broadcom Wireless draft-n
cards, why DRAFT-n has caught on so much is beond me, its not even the
real deal yet. So you have three options return and get a new laptop,
fight with finding a card that your computer wont reject (some people
have had all kinds of problems tricking there computer to think the
card is the one it came with), or get a USB wireless stick.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> So.. where do I go from here ?
