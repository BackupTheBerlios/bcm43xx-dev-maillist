<PRE>Hmmm...why didn't yahoo include the list ?.. 

&quot;Arne Chr. Jorgensen&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">achrisjo at yahoo.com</A>&gt; wrote: hi,

In my dialog with Larry, I asked:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, just some idea.  Perhaps I could install Suse, replicate your 
</I>&gt;<i> settings and check it ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Now, I am running OpenSuse 10.2, with default x86_86 kernel 2.6.18.2-34.
I am unfamilar with Suse, and a bit unsure as how to set it up. 
At the moment it uses a Vesa frame buffer device, and perhaps I should
try to compile a NVIDIA driver - any suggestions ? 

( did try once, but didn't get it working)

Next, I had to download and install nForceth driver from NVIDIA, as the wire
ethernet wouldn't be recognized. Then I have got some code installed to control the &quot;tapping&quot; feature of the touchpad.

As reported earlier, the Fedora update kernels had the machine go crazy.
So even with the &quot;tapping enabled&quot; in Suse, the behaviour isn't as wild as
it was with Fedora. Perhaps Fedora kernels don't recognize the AMD stuff.

My confusion have had something to do  with the impression that in one particular install - I had wireless up.  I still cannot swear it, I could have been fooled by something it pulled up from the cache, but as I have
said - this wasn't my impression. I have been checking pages all over to figure out this thing. In the end I did open this damn thing, to see what this card looked like. 

Surprise - the chips says BCM4311KFBG... what the heck ?? Checking data at
HP, which says what I have reported earlier. But in the end I found some
partlist that seems to operate with two different part numbers, not saying
what the chip set might be, but there is 2 and 3 wire antenna versions.

Checking registry in Vista - reveals Broadcom..and then 4312 ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is exactly the computer I have. The wireless is a BCM4311. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
( take it that your wireless is working, that there is some driver for it ?)

If so, then what do I need to do ?

As I  did mention earlier Larry, your hardware didn't seem that far apart from
mine. Perhaps you have some configuration file, what options need to be included in compiling a kernel ?  ( There are a whole lot of options that
I don't have a clue what they are for. )

Oh, by the way - in Suse, I have no sound. (HD Audio-Conexant CX20549-12)
- according to the info pages from HP. ( did come up in Fedora )

Looking at those specifications from HP again - it does say:

&quot;Broadcom 4321AGN Wi-Fi Adapter (802.11 a/b/g/ draft-n) + Bluetooth w/2      antennas&quot;

But as I checked inside, Bluetooth is supported by a separate card. ( Broadcom, as far as I know..does have some designs with Bluetooth - but in
this case, the blue tooth don't seem to have any relation to Broadcom )
Also.. using the Serial number, service number, or any number - will lead
you to this info from HP, - so at least I was made to believe the info  was
correct. 

( Sorry about the length, but - in case someone else got fooled like I have
been )

So.. where do I go from here ?
