</I>&gt;<i> This does looks close - and it did run with wireless ???
</I>&gt;<i> Do adapter/chip do you have ?
</I>
This is exactly the computer I have. The wireless is a BCM4311. The only difference with what I have 
is that I bought an extra 1 GB RAM card, which meant I had to pull one of the 512 MB ones, thus I 
have 1.5 GB RAM. The extra was for testing - it isn't needed.

&gt;<i>                                   ----------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You also said:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; A great many HP/Compaq laptops run Linux very well. For example, I have
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; had an HP dv2125nr for about 6 months, and I am using openSUSE 10.2 
</I>&gt;<i> on it.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Every piece of hardware works on it using a native Linux driver 
</I>&gt;<i> except for the modem and
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the xD card reader.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this have blue-tooth ?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> Here is what I found told about mine:
</I>&gt;<i> --Broadcom 4321AGN Wi-Fi Adapter (802.11 a/b/g/ draft-n) w/2 antennas
</I>&gt;<i> --( guess one part may be blue-tooth - but I don't have a clue )
</I>
No - 802.11n uses multiple antennas to get extra speed. I think that is what they mean.

&gt;<i> Now, I can still keep it for a week or more ( have a 30 day return deal 
</I>&gt;<i> on it ) Perhaps you
</I>&gt;<i> could guide me through some tests ??  Perhaps it could give some info in 
</I>&gt;<i> return ?
</I>
That draft N BCM card is not going to work with the native driver for quite some time. Our reverse 
engineers have no plans to get to it, and until they do, there will be no driver.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's design a chip, call it 777 and what we have from earlier, is a 747 
</I>&gt;<i> - so we use much of the
</I>&gt;<i> same core. This thing above may have some of the same core as the 
</I>&gt;<i> earlier ones. But something is
</I>&gt;<i> added to it.
</I>
Yes, something was added that makes it fly totally differently.

&gt;<i> There was something funny !  I cannot swear it, but during one of my 
</I>&gt;<i> boot-ups, I think I had
</I>&gt;<i> wireless working !  I pulled out the network cable, and it did seem like 
</I>&gt;<i> I actually were online.
</I>
I am skeptical.

&gt;<i> But the sensitivity on the touchpad, the &quot;tapping&quot; setting, had me screw 
</I>&gt;<i> up everything. I had trouble
</I>&gt;<i> with the display settings, and several other things.
</I>
I always edit the X configuration file and turn off tapping. I hate it. I also modify the 
sensitivity to fit my wants.

&gt;<i> I don't know how to set up wlan, the network settings, scripts, etc.
</I>
On openSUSE, all those settings are handled through a configuration tool called YaST Yet another 
Setup Tool). I know where the files live, but I don't need to change them manually anymore. 
Similarly, wireless is configured through NetworkManager, now. The only problem with openSUSE 10.2 
is that the supported kernel is 2.6.18, which is not new enough to properly support BCM43xx 
wireless. The driver didn't really work well in mainline kernels until 2.6.21.

&gt;<i> Well, looking at the hardware listed above - they don't seem that far 
</I>&gt;<i> apart. And I did get this hunch that your machine wouldn't swallow these 
</I>&gt;<i> new kernel updates. Why does it work on the initial kernels ?
</I>
My machine can handle any of the latest kernels. What makes you think it won't work with newer ones?

&gt;<i> Most of my focus was on the 86_64 capabilities. Would it run that ?  
</I>
I only run an x86_64 system. Wouldn't ever go back to an i386 machine.

&gt;<i> Right now it does on an earlier
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora6 kernel. But I didn't have that one back then. Only Fedora7, 
</I>&gt;<i> which did boot up as far as I know, but the software updater would 
</I>&gt;<i> download a newer kernel, which had everything go wrong. Same thing with 
</I>&gt;<i> all the Fedora releases. I don't know why, did notice some different 
</I>&gt;<i> kernel-modules, but else ? I don't know.
</I>
IO don't know why that happened. It shouldn't have.

&gt;<i> As a check, I downloaded OpenSuse 10.2, the 86x64 version, and it did 
</I>&gt;<i> seem okay. But I am unfamiliar
</I>&gt;<i> with Suse, don't know where I find the startup scripts, and such...so, 
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed it did run x86_64,
</I>&gt;<i> I went back and tried F7.9 test release.
</I>
To each his own.

&gt;<i> Well, looking at the hardware listed above - they don't seem that far 
</I>&gt;<i> apart. And I did get this hunch that your machine wouldn't swallow these 
</I>&gt;<i> new kernel updates. Why does it work on the initial kernels ? 
</I>
My machine is running a 2.6.23-rc5 kernel - the latest there is. For testing purposes, I always use 
the latest one in the Linux mainstream distribution. I still don't know where your hunch came from.

&gt;<i> Well, just some idea.  Perhaps I could install Suse, replicate your 
</I>&gt;<i> settings and check it ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I might be wrong, just to much did happen at the same time in that 
</I>&gt;<i> episode - so I can't say for sure
</I>&gt;<i> if it did get the wlan up. What kernel modules to use, etc.. well, I 
</I>&gt;<i> haven't done any good test.
