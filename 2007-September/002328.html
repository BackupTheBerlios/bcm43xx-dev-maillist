<PRE>Hi,

Well, first of all - thanks a lot for the informative inputs. 

Larry first:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stay away from the &quot;just-introduced, latest and greatest&quot; models.
</I>&gt;<i> The model that came out 3 months ago is more likely to be supported.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, for a half year - I have been using an old Toshiba (486) with RH6? - and 
started seeing the advantage of a laptop ;) got tired of those floppy disks ;)
 
So, I guess that might explain why I didn't pick up the meaning of 11N right away.

johannes:

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Broadcom is not releasing information on how to program it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm...and they have a contract with HP and others, so...else I did see some
Linux drivers on their site - but for what, I don't know.. 

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can, return it, the wireless in it is dead. You could possibly
</I>&gt;<i> swap it out but it might or might not work and it usually takes a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks...I have wasted more time then I do care to think of...having had
some odd hardware. 

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Someone mentioned a &quot;Ndiswrapper&quot; - is that the same thing ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, its a crappy workaround to run Windows drivers in the Linux kernel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I see.. it may work well, it may not. 


                          ------------------


Larry gave a good description of the effort to get some Linux driver, which was
some of my point when asking &quot;why reverse engineer ?&quot;.  No fair competition.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Broadcom wireless chips require a complicated interaction......
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Enough ;)  - or I'll soon take the damn thing apart to look inside ;)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Besides the wireless problem, the second area of difficulty is with
</I>&gt;<i> disk controllers, which I think is the reason for the crashes you noted 
</I>&gt;<i> in your first post. Since laptops switched to SATA controllers, the changes 
</I>&gt;<i> have been very rapid. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not up to date in that area either. I did notice someone saying something, perhaps
it was when I had a short peek at your archieves ?  Something about ACPI..something
about power control, etc. There seem to be some nVidia chips controlling quite a bit
of it all. With newer kernels, it was like single stepping parts of the boot-up 
sequence, as I would press the power on/off button. Just some thought....

Unfortunatly, I don't know much about the kernel, or kernel drivers, etc. And it has
become harder to keep pace with the development.  On the other hand, I do feel lost
if placed in front of a Microsoft Window ;) ...so, I guess I will have to stick to
some linux boxes...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (3) For Broadcom wireless, look for BCM4311 or BCM4312 cards. Stay away
</I>&gt;<i>  from pre-N stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
pre..802.11n - is that what you meant ?

Probably what I'll have to do. I have little use of Microsoft....

Thanks guys,

- now...what else are you up to in this place, me wonder..;)
