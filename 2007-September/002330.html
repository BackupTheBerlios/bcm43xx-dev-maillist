This does looks close - and it did run with wireless ???
Do adapter/chip do you have ?

                                  ----------------------

You also said:

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A great many HP/Compaq laptops run Linux very well. For example, I have
</I>&gt;<i> had an HP dv2125nr for about 6 months, and I am using openSUSE 10.2 on it. 
</I>&gt;<i> Every piece of hardware works on it using a native Linux driver except for the modem and 
</I>&gt;<i> the xD card reader.
</I>&gt;<i>

Does this have blue-tooth ?

Here is what I found told about mine:
--Broadcom 4321AGN Wi-Fi Adapter (802.11 a/b/g/ draft-n) w/2 antennas 
--( guess one part may be blue-tooth - but I don't have a clue )


                                  ----------------------

Now, I can still keep it for a week or more ( have a 30 day return deal on it ) Perhaps you
could guide me through some tests ??  Perhaps it could give some info in return ?

Let's design a chip, call it 777 and what we have from earlier, is a 747 - so we use much of the
same core. This thing above may have some of the same core as the earlier ones. But something is
added to it. 

There was something funny !  I cannot swear it, but during one of my boot-ups, I think I had
wireless working !  I pulled out the network cable, and it did seem like I actually were online.

But the sensitivity on the touchpad, the &quot;tapping&quot; setting, had me screw up everything. I had trouble
with the display settings, and several other things.

I don't know how to set up wlan, the network settings, scripts, etc. 


Well, looking at the hardware listed above - they don't seem that far apart. And I did get this hunch that your machine wouldn't swallow these new kernel updates. Why does it work on the initial kernels ? 

Most of my focus was on the 86_64 capabilities. Would it run that ?  Right now it does on an earlier
Fedora6 kernel. But I didn't have that one back then. Only Fedora7, which did boot up as far as I know, but the software updater would download a newer kernel, which had everything go wrong. Same thing with all the Fedora releases. I don't know why, did notice some different kernel-modules, but else ? I don't know.

As a check, I downloaded OpenSuse 10.2, the 86x64 version, and it did seem okay. But I am unfamiliar
with Suse, don't know where I find the startup scripts, and such...so, confirmed it did run x86_64,
I went back and tried F7.9 test release. 

Well, looking at the hardware listed above - they don't seem that far apart. And I did get this hunch that your machine wouldn't swallow these new kernel updates. Why does it work on the initial kernels ?  

Well, just some idea.  Perhaps I could install Suse, replicate your settings and check it ?

I might be wrong, just to much did happen at the same time in that episode - so I can't say for sure
if it did get the wlan up. What kernel modules to use, etc.. well, I haven't done any good test.
