<PRE>2008/5/2 Francesco Gringoli &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">francesco.gringoli at ing.unibs.it</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Just a question (for Francis): how does the AP work? Have you tried very
</I>&gt;<i> stressing tests with traffic crossing the AP?
</I>
The AP works fine for now. When it has just started up, though, the
first association sometimes drops immediately and has to be redone.
Not sure whether this bug is related to the b43 driver or hostapd.

I haven't tried stress testing via the AP though, since I only have
one client for now. A second is to come later today. What I've tried
is, from the client:

dd if=/dev/zero |ssh the.ap cat '&gt;'/dev/null

for a good hour. The AP didn't seem to mind. I even did casual
Internet browsing while doing this and it went fine (no interactivity
problems).

When I have the second client online, I'll try this command from the
first client to the second.

&gt;<i> We do have problems when the
</I>&gt;<i> channel is saturated, it seems that the BCM device acting as AP stops
</I>&gt;<i> sending beacons and the BSS goes down, we need to reconfigure everything
</I>&gt;<i> when this happens (I mean, stop and restart hostapd and reset ifaces on
</I>&gt;<i> STAs). The configuration we are trying is built exclusively on BCM+b43
</I>&gt;<i> devices running wireless git, one is configured as AP using the patch from
</I>&gt;<i> Johannes Berg.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not the case here: the first client uses ipw2200, the second one will
have a Netgear WG311 v2, (acx111 chipset). Both clients run vanilla
Ubuntu 8.04, I didn't even change the kernel and I don't plan to,
either (unless this can be of some interest to you).

&gt;<i>  I remember a post (from Johannes) where he stated that there are still
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;problems with beaconing&quot;. Is this still true?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Honestly, I have no idea. What should I look for in the logs? I run
the b43 driver in debug mode.

Have fun,

&quot;It seems obvious [...] that at least some 'business intelligence'
tools invest so much intelligence on the business side that they have
nothing left for generating SQL queries&quot; (St&#233;phane Faroult, in &quot;The
Art of SQL&quot;, ISBN 0-596-00894-5)
