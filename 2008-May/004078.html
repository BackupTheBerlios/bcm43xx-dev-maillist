The whole thing in 1 piece, take two:

In q&amp;a section:
Q: I found a bug in the driver, now what?

A: See &lt;link to topic &quot;Bug reporting&quot;&gt;
-------------------
topic &quot;Bug reporting&quot;:

Bug reporting

You should send a message to the b43/b43legacy mailinglist at 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">bcm43xx-dev at berlios.de</A> containing ALL of the following:

A description of the problem at hand:
* When does it happen.
* How to reproduce

uname -a
lspci -vvn|grep 43 -A7
dmesg

wlan configuration, authentication/encryption type

In addition this may be of interest to the developers:

If you have built the kernel from git:
    Tell which tree, and the output of &quot;git describe&quot;

If the bug worked with earlier kernels, but has since stopped working, a 
bisection is of great value.
