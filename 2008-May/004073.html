I'm really unsure on what your actual problem is, Ehud.
Is there some bug to be solved? If yes, please provide some debugging
information, instead of whining.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Still others have said to please don't toppost because the threads 
</I>&gt;<i> become hard to read...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, some constructive proposals:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A) Start a mailing list bcm43xx-users with a nicer and more forgiving 
</I>&gt;<i> tone that doesn't scare away bug reporters and testers.
</I>
Creating a new mainlinglist won't help anyone.
It will just split up developers and users to seperate lists.
That's the opposite of what you want.

&gt;<i> B) If it's not already done, on linux-wireless / b43 site: Tell how to 
</I>&gt;<i> report bugs, with directions on what info is relevant.
</I>
Feel free to write a bug-report HOWTO.

&gt;<i> C) Set up a bug report form on linux-wireless/b43 site that force needed 
</I>&gt;<i> info to be included.
</I>
Cool. Please implement that.

&gt;<i> Testers is one of the most needed resource in software development, why 
</I>&gt;<i> throw it all away with hostility. I've seen a lot of that on this list, 
</I>&gt;<i> which in comparison to lkml is a nightmare
</I>
No wait. LKML is the actual nightmare. It's one of the best examples
for the worst mailinglist ever. ;)

&gt;<i> To be fair I know exactly how frustrating it is to get incomplete 
</I>&gt;<i> reports over and over again. Maybe I'm naive to think it can be worked 
</I>&gt;<i> around and minimized.
</I>
Yeah well. People should read the list archives or use google before
asking questions. The traffic could be reduced by 50%.
The signal/noise ratio is very bad on this list.
