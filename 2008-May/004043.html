&gt;<i> Date: Wed, 7 May 2008 22:18:32 -0500
</I>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">Larry.Finger at lwfinger.net</A>
</I>
&lt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Apparently there's more than just these bits in the sprom controlling the LED
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> behaviour? Does anyone know what that might be?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you should expect from the 0xFF values; however, you have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not enabled the LED select stuff in your kernel. If you had, you would see
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lines like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> b43-phy0 debug: 64-bit DMA initialized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ....if it's supposed to say '64bit' , it doesn't here...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is a function of your card, not your OS. Mine is 64-bit, yours is 
</I>&gt;<i> 32-bit, and others are 30-bit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
....i see...

&gt;<i>&lt;&gt;
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Using kernel menuconfig, one will typically configure networking--&gt;wireless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before they get to  device drivers--&gt;LED support. This is unfortunate if one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has started the kernel configuration with devices drivers--&gt;led support--&gt;led trigger support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unset, as led trigger support isn't displayed in networking--&gt;wireless with this option unset.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, configuration is not a straight-line process. In LKML, they are 
</I>&gt;<i> currently discussing changes that would gray out those options that do not 
</I>&gt;<i> have their prerequisites met.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
....well, that might help...provided the  option still works on a gray option,
and tells the user what the prerequisite actually is that's currently unset. Otherwise,
a torrent of &quot;what does it mean when an option is grayed out? How do I fix this?&quot;
questions are likely to be observed....


&gt;&gt;<i> Still stupid human error, I know, but that's how a person gets led into it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyhow, thanks for pointing that out, now I get ;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b43-phy0: Loading firmware version 410.2160 (2007-05-26 15:32:10)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b43-phy0 debug: Chip initialized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b43-phy0 debug: 32-bit DMA initialized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Registered led device: b43-phy0::tx
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Registered led device: b43-phy0::rx
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Registered led device: b43-phy0::assoc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b43-phy0 debug: Wireless interface started
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b43-phy0 debug: Adding Interface type 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .......
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The rx/tx LED behaviour is working as expected with the 0xFF sprom values
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that come with this asus card type....afaict.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Glad to be able to fix a problem quickly. Lately, it has been taking a long 
</I>&gt;<i> time. Perhaps the bugs are getting more subtle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, thanks for the ASUS PCI card. I didn't do very much toward fixing 
</I>&gt;<i> the problem, but I was able to confirm that there was really a problem, and 
</I>&gt;<i> your difficulties weren't due to your spelling of behavior, the sun being in 
</I>&gt;<i> the north, or any other geographic factors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Not a problem, if only to confirm the problem existed, it was worth it. As to
the speed finding &amp; fixing the issue, I personally thought things happened
pretty fast to arrive at the eventual resolution. I think Stefanik deserves an
extra cookie of credit here for having the idea to substitute sprom images.
Everyone who helped out gets cookies as well for outstanding effort. (;

..next, I can move onto my original notion of using one of these cards in AP mode...

&gt;<i> I'm particularly sensitive to the differences between British and American 
</I>&gt;<i> spelling. I once co-authored a book with another American. It was published 
</I>&gt;<i> by Wiley and Sons out of their UK office. The text went in with US spelling, 
</I>&gt;<i> but the galley proofs had UK spelling. We dutifully changed them all, but 
</I>&gt;<i> that had no effect. In the final version of the book, color was spelled 
</I>&gt;<i> colour, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Larry
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That is a disappointing outcome -- I'd understand you feeling you're like the victim
of some form of nationalistic prejudice in such circumstance...ie; if I'd written a book
adhering to the spelling examples contained in the Australian Macquarie lexicon, I 
would expect what was published still to be in that original form. I'm typically
ambivalent of/to the spelling differences you speak of, so I am truly apologetic
if that stance has upset/affronted you or anyone else on this list.

Regards,

            Donald
