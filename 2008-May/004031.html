<PRE>
Greets,

             Apologies for previous noise about 2.6.24 ooopsing.  It wasn't relevant..

As queried, I grabbed the (then) latest wireless-testing tree, and that compiled &amp;
loaded modules without the noted errors. The asus card worked, although in this
case the rx/tx LED remains off the entire time. The performance was a bit hap-
hazard, and dmesg would contain passages like ;

May  5 19:31:39 sfs64 kernel: b43-phy0 ERROR: MAC suspend failed
May  5 20:58:44 sfs64 kernel: b43-phy0 ERROR: MAC suspend failed
May  5 21:18:57 sfs64 kernel: wlan0: No ProbeResp from current AP 00:18:4d:2c:57:5e - assume out of range

...and most of the time I found I had to manually reassociate with the AP using
iwconfig to re-establish the link. Typically what I'll try to do to test the link, is
use mythtv to stream hdtv content across it -- this simply would not happen,
and if it could be got running the dropped packet count made viewing the
stream most annoying. No file transfers ever seemed corrupted, just real time
streaming was so affected.

As of today May 06 and an update of the wireless-testing tree, the new
kernel build seems to be working much better, and dmesg chatter has stopped
altogether as per above. Nor does the link association drop-out any more as
per above. Thruput is much improved, and..eg; mythtv streaming now almost
works perfectly - there's still a replay 'stutter' I have to get to the bottom of
that coincides with sporadic packet drop, however things are -much- better
than previously experienced here. For the record...;

wlan0: switched to short barker preamble (BSSID=00:18:4d:2c:57:5e)

This is just using WEP and with kernel 2.6.25wl IOMMU=on. This level of
debug has been otherwise quiet since init...20hours ago. (previously I'd
become used to the above error occurring every 2-3hours or so). I should
add I haven't seen this happening on the 32bit box at all (I haven't yet
upgraded it's tree to current 'cos it hasn't demonstrated the same problem).


I'm a tad confused about the rx/tx LED behaviour - although I do understand
what was previously said regarding this. My confusion stems from the fact
that b43 &amp; 2.6.24 on 32bit with the asus 138gv2 card flashed with the sprom
image Stefanik provided, got the card working initially - it also got the rx/tx
LED working 'as it should'. Now...stupid me thought this would merely be a
case of looking at the sprom values between the two different sprom images,
to deduce what the values should be...however, if we're talking about these bits here -;

SPROM(0x64, LED 0 behaviour) = 0xFF
SPROM(0x65, LED 1 behaviour) = 0xFF
SPROM(0x66, LED 2 behaviour) = 0xFF
SPROM(0x67, LED 3 behaviour) = 0xFF

....then they're actually the -same- in both sprom image varients.

Apparently there's more than just these bits in the sprom controlling the LED
behaviour? Does anyone know what that might be?


   Kind Regards,

                     Donald

</I>&gt;<i> According to the README of the Vista driver, the card supports Afterburner, but not SpeedBooster. SpeedBooster is only supported by WL-138gE. However, the page on asus.com about the card no longer talks about Afterburner support (it did, previously). So, the right overrides are 0x0048 for 14E4:4318:1043:100F, and 0x0248 for the WL-138gE version (14E4:4318:1043:120F if I remember correctly). (This message is a repost because I forgot to CC the list, as usual.)
