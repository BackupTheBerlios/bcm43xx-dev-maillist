At present, I have a BCM4311 rev 2 in my laptop so that device gets lots of 
testing. I used to have a 4311/1, but that laptop was recalled and replaced. 
To help debug this particular issue, I just bought a D1490 on E-bay. I also 
have a BCM4310, which has an LP-PHY and is the reason I'm working on the RE 
for that device.

If the developers feel that a new laptop would be desirable, I certainly 
would not object; however, we do have coverage for these devices.
