<PRE>Hi all,

One day I was testing monitor-while-operating, with &quot;wlan0&quot; as the
managed interface and &quot;rtap0&quot; as the monitor one, and found an
interesting bug: when I am associated with an AP on wlan0, and try to
receive the same AP's packets through the monitor interface, the
packets arrive in decrypted form, but with the WEP bit still set. This
appears to be a HW-crypto-related bug, though I haven't tested with HW
crypto off. What can cause such a bug?

Thanks,
G&#225;bor
