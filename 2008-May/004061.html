<PRE>The newest Ubuntu release called Hardy Heron has a 2.6.24 kernel with bcm43xx 
blacklisted, resulting in a lot of users for b43 and b43legacy. Based on some 
of the queries that had hit our list, I decided to configure Ubuntu 
partitions on both my x86_64 laptop and my i386 desktop machine. I then went 
to their active bug list and tackled those that seemed to be real problems 
with our drivers.

The short version of my results is that patches have been submitted and 
accepted to fix all known problems with b43legacy when using 802.11b devices. 
I also submitted the patches needed for implementation of 4311/2 and 4312/2 
cards including the disabling of A-PHY's on 802.11a/b/g units. The 4311/2 
patch had been in trial versions of the Hardy kernel and reportedly caused a 
regression for a 4312/1 user. I don't understand that problem. If anyone 
reading this list knows of a similar problem, please let me know. Because of 
this history, they are being careful with the 4311/2 changes.

Of particular importance to this list, a patch to turn on ssb and b43 
debugging in their default configurations was accepted. Strangely, debugging 
for b43legacy and bcm43xx was already included. It should be easier to make 
sense of their problems once these changes are included in their kernels.

&lt;mini-rant&gt;
This has been my first experience with Debian-based systems. The philosophy 
seems to be &quot;make it as difficult as possible for the user to modify the 
kernel&quot;. When testing changes in a module under openSUSE 10.3, I can compile, 
install the new module, unload the old one, and test the new one in less than 
5 minutes on most of my machines. With Ubuntu, that took at least 30 minutes. 
For one of the bugs, I discovered that the problem had been fixed in current 
mainline, so I used openSUSE to bisect between 2.6.25 and 2.6.24 to find the 
problem. It was much faster that way.
&lt;/mini-rant&gt;
