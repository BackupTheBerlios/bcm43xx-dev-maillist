I certainly understand the Ubuntu developers having some hesitancy over this 
issue, and I have no quarrel with that. What I don't understand is how this 
patch had any possible effect on the 4311/1 devices. I was the author of the 
patch, which consists of 9 hunks. Of these, one corrects a typo in a comment, 
four fix problems with 64-bit DMA, one adds the new 802.11 revision number, 
and two handle the recognition of the new PHY revision. As the 4311/1 uses 
32-bit DMA, none of these have any effect on those devices. If you do the 
count, there is one hunk remaining. It increases the number of receive DMA 
slots and should have no effect on performance.
