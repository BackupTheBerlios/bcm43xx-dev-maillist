become hard to read...

Anyway, some constructive proposals:

A) Start a mailing list bcm43xx-users with a nicer and more forgiving 
tone that doesn't scare away bug reporters and testers.

B) If it's not already done, on linux-wireless / b43 site: Tell how to 
report bugs, with directions on what info is relevant.

C) Set up a bug report form on linux-wireless/b43 site that force needed 
info to be included.

Testers is one of the most needed resource in software development, why 
throw it all away with hostility. I've seen a lot of that on this list, 
which in comparison to lkml is a nightmare for someone who god forbids 
don't magically know what kind of info a dev might need.

To be fair I know exactly how frustrating it is to get incomplete 
reports over and over again. Maybe I'm naive to think it can be worked 
around and minimized.

And oh, I'm not picking specifically on this thread, but the list as a 
whole.
