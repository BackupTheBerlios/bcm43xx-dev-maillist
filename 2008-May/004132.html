Still, you may want to report it to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">linux-wireless at vger.kernel.org</A>

&gt;<i> The reaction on modprobe:
</I>&gt;<i> # modprobe -f b43
</I>&gt;<i> WARNING: Error inserting ssb
</I>&gt;<i> (/lib/modules/2.6.24-gentoo-r7/kernel/drivers/ssb/ssb.ko): Invalid
</I>&gt;<i> module format
</I>
It means the replacement ssb module failed to install.  It would be
under &quot;updates&quot; instead of &quot;kernel&quot;.

&gt;<i> Well, I don't have pcmcia in my kernel config, because I don't need it.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a certain kernel setting requirement that I miss?
</I>
I believe there is no such requirement (although I haven't tried that).
If such requirement exists, the build system should report it.

I only see one reference to PCMCIA on the download page:

&quot;Additionally, the kernel you're building for needs a valid &quot;.config&quot;
file, if it isn't present compat will assume you have PCI, USB and
PCMCIA built into your kernel and if not, fail building.&quot;

So, maybe your .config file wasn't found.

&gt;<i> Then I found a command &quot;b43load&quot; somewhere in the &quot;wireless-compat&quot; tree, but
</I>&gt;<i> b43load complains about the same error as above and eventually loads
</I>&gt;<i> the module b43legacy... well... which doesn't work...
</I>
It confirms that the installation was incomplete.

&gt;<i> &gt; If it doesn't help, check the antenna connectors on the card if they are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accessible.
</I>&gt;<i> It's a laptop from my work. I am not planning to open it and fiddle
</I>&gt;<i> around with any connectors. Let's say, it is built-in and just not
</I>&gt;<i> accessable.
</I>
OK, chances are it's OK if you didn't touch it.

&gt;<i> &gt;  Also try ndiswrapper to rule out problems unrelated to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b43 driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ndiswrapper acts weired as well. I installed version 1.52.
</I>&gt;<i> I did blacklist these guys: b43, b43legacy, ccb.
</I>&gt;<i> I downloaded the windows driver and installed it. ndiswrapper seems to be happy:
</I>&gt;<i> # ndiswrapper -l
</I>&gt;<i> bcmwl5 : driver installed
</I>&gt;<i>        device (14E4:4311) present (alternate driver: ssb)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> however, iwconfig says:
</I>&gt;<i> # iwconfig
</I>&gt;<i> lo        no wireless extensions.
</I>&gt;<i> eth0      no wireless extensions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> basically, no wireless device showing up here (also the LED stays off).
</I>
modprobe ndiswrapper

&gt;<i> Summary:
</I>&gt;<i> The wifi here did work some time ago. It is only recently that it
</I>&gt;<i> rendered that broken. I used to use ndiswrapper one year ago, at some
</I>&gt;<i> point I switched to b43.
</I>
So, I guess b43 stopped working one day?

&gt;<i> Just one restriction: I'd like to stick to 2.6.24 for the time being,
</I>&gt;<i> as the vmware-modules don't compile against 2.6.25 kernels yet.
</I>
compat-wireless supports 2.6.22 and newer.
