I wish these weren't reported at all.
First fact is we can't do anything about them anyway.
Second fact is that we already know about possible performance problems.
So I consider &quot;I only get poor performance of 11MBit/s&quot; as noise on the list.

&gt;<i> If the bug is a regression, ie the driver worked with earlier kernels, 
</I>&gt;<i> but stopped working, a bisection is of great value.

I'd remove the word &quot;regression&quot; here.
People use it way too often, even if it's their fault that the device stopped
working. The bad thing about the word is that it attracts upstream people
like a magnet, as upstream maintainers don't like _real_ regressions, of course.
So it wastes a lot of peoples' times.
I'd rather have people report bugs as usual and let the _maintainers_ (like me)
put attributes like &quot;regression&quot; to it. A &quot;regression&quot; is a showstopper.
What most people report are minor bugs in the global view.

The rest of the text looks pretty good.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; C) Set up a bug report form on linux-wireless/b43 site that force needed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; info to be included.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cool. Please implement that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Was afraid of that answer, don't have the resources atm, maybe later, no 
</I>&gt;<i> promises. Also I don't know what drives that site. And maintenance != me
</I>
it's moinmoin based. You can contact Johannes Berg, if you are interested in
implementing such a thing.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Testers is one of the most needed resource in software development, why 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; throw it all away with hostility. I've seen a lot of that on this list, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which in comparison to lkml is a nightmare
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No wait. LKML is the actual nightmare. It's one of the best examples
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the worst mailinglist ever. ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> On LKML I find no question is to stupid to be answered in a polite 
</I>&gt;<i> manner.

Hahahaha. You're only subscribed since two or three weeks, right? :)
