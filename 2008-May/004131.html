<PRE>First, thanks for your reply.

&gt;<i> I suggest that you try the driver from
</I>&gt;<i> compat-wireless, which is the latest driver backported to the recent
</I>&gt;<i> kernels: <A HREF="http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Download">http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Download</A>
</I>
I did that. The thing is only, I get compile issues, which wouldn't
bother me too much, as long as b43 would be working fine...
The reaction on modprobe:
# modprobe -f b43
WARNING: Error inserting ssb
(/lib/modules/2.6.24-gentoo-r7/kernel/drivers/ssb/ssb.ko): Invalid
module format
FATAL: Error inserting b43
(/lib/modules/2.6.24-gentoo-r7/updates/drivers/net/wireless/b43/b43.ko):
Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg)

The dmesg says:
ssb: no version magic, tainting kernel.
ssb: exports duplicate symbol ssb_admatch_size (owned by kernel)
ssb: no version magic, tainting kernel.
ssb: exports duplicate symbol ssb_admatch_size (owned by kernel)
b43: no version magic, tainting kernel.
b43: Unknown symbol pcmcia_disable_device

b43: Unknown symbol pcmcia_map_mem_page
b43: Unknown symbol ssb_bus_suspend
b43: Unknown symbol led_classdev_unregister
b43: Unknown symbol ssb_bus_resume
b43: Unknown symbol pccard_get_first_tuple
b43: Unknown symbol pcmcia_request_window
b43: Unknown symbol pcmcia_request_configuration
b43: Unknown symbol ssb_bus_pcmciabus_register

b43: Unknown symbol pcmcia_register_driver
b43: Unknown symbol led_classdev_register
b43: Unknown symbol pccard_parse_tuple
b43: Unknown symbol pcmcia_request_irq

Well, I don't have pcmcia in my kernel config, because I don't need it.
Is there a certain kernel setting requirement that I miss? I tried
dis/enabling module-version support ( Don't ask me why! ???)
Do I really have to enable that pccard and pcmcia stuff there?

Then I found a command &quot;b43load&quot; somewhere in the &quot;wireless-compat&quot; tree, but
b43load complains about the same error as above and eventually loads
the module b43legacy... well... which doesn't work...

&gt;<i> If it doesn't help, check the antenna connectors on the card if they are
</I>&gt;<i> accessible.
</I>It's a laptop from my work. I am not planning to open it and fiddle
around with any connectors. Let's say, it is built-in and just not
accessable.

&gt;<i>  Also try ndiswrapper to rule out problems unrelated to the
</I>&gt;<i> b43 driver.
</I>
ndiswrapper acts weired as well. I installed version 1.52.
I did blacklist these guys: b43, b43legacy, ccb.
I downloaded the windows driver and installed it. ndiswrapper seems to be happy:
# ndiswrapper -l
bcmwl5 : driver installed
       device (14E4:4311) present (alternate driver: ssb)

however, iwconfig says:
# iwconfig
lo        no wireless extensions.
eth0      no wireless extensions.

basically, no wireless device showing up here (also the LED stays off).

Summary:
The wifi here did work some time ago. It is only recently that it
rendered that broken. I used to use ndiswrapper one year ago, at some
point I switched to b43. I mean, it's not real fun to go through those
changes in the wifi infrastructure every half a year...
But I do it, it's alright to tinker with all that stuff ;-), but
this... I don't know. It's getting tedious, isn't it?

If you would need/want more details, just post it, I'll provide it,
I'd really get it running again.
Just one restriction: I'd like to stick to 2.6.24 for the time being,
as the vmware-modules don't compile against 2.6.25 kernels yet.

Cheers,
Sandro
