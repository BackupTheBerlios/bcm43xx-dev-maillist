Something like this?

In q&amp;a section:
Q: I found a bug in the driver, now what?

A: See &lt;link to topic &quot;Bug reporting&quot;&gt;
-------------------
topic &quot;Bug reporting&quot;:

Bug reporting

You should send a message to the b43/b43legacy mailinglist at 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">bcm43xx-dev at berlios.de</A> containing ALL of the following:

A description of the problem at hand:
* When does it happen.
* How to reproduce
* If performance is poor; What environment is your wlan in, walls, 
distance etc.

uname -a
lspci -vvn|grep 43 -A7
dmesg

wlan configuration, authentication/encryption type

In addition this may be of interest to the developers:

If you have built the kernel from git:
   Tell which tree, and the output of &quot;git describe&quot;

If the bug is a regression, ie the driver worked with earlier kernels, 
but stopped working, a bisection is of great value.

(I probably missed a few relevant points)

&gt;&gt;<i> C) Set up a bug report form on linux-wireless/b43 site that force needed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> info to be included.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cool. Please implement that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Was afraid of that answer, don't have the resources atm, maybe later, no 
promises. Also I don't know what drives that site. And maintenance != me

&gt;&gt;<i> Testers is one of the most needed resource in software development, why 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throw it all away with hostility. I've seen a lot of that on this list, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which in comparison to lkml is a nightmare
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No wait. LKML is the actual nightmare. It's one of the best examples
</I>&gt;<i> for the worst mailinglist ever. ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>On LKML I find no question is to stupid to be answered in a polite 
manner. OTOH it's a nightmare traffic wise.

&gt;&gt;<i> To be fair I know exactly how frustrating it is to get incomplete 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reports over and over again. Maybe I'm naive to think it can be worked

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah well. People should read the list archives or use google before
</I>&gt;<i> asking questions. The traffic could be reduced by 50%.
</I>&gt;<i> The signal/noise ratio is very bad on this list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Maybe I'm the only person in the world finding it more or less 
impossible to find anything in mailing list archives, unless you find it 
through a search engine. Besides most messages on a ML get obsolete very 
quickly.
