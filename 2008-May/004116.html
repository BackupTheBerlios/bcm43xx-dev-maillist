Although I don't claim to be a lawyer, I found this information from 
<A HREF="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/fcc-sdr-whitepaper.html,">http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/fcc-sdr-whitepaper.html,</A> 
which is a translation of the FCC's rules regarding software defined 
radios (including 802.11 chips).

Snippet 1:

The rules require any manufacturer certifying a device under the new 
process to take steps to prevent &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; changes to the software 
on the device that might alter its radio frequency and power parameters 
in a way that takes it out of compliance with the regulations known as 
FCC Part 15 regulations.2 The specific technology implemented to 
accomplish this task is left to the manufacturers seeking certification, 
although the FCC suggests several possible mechanisms that can serve as 
such &#8220;security measures.&#8221;3

Snippet 2:

Since software is a representation of a mathematical algorithm, it is 
not a &#8220;device&#8221;, &#8220;home electronic equipment&#8221; or a &#8220;home electronic ... 
system.&#8221;17 Further, there is no precedent for applying the device 
certification rules to software except as installed as a component of a 
specific hardware device. Indeed, the FCC has explicitly limited the 
certification requirements to &#8220;hardware-based device[s].&#8221;18 Both of 
these facts make it clear that the FCC rules do not apply to software by 
itself, but only to hardware-based devices.


What I get out of this, and out of poking in the legal babble, is that 
as long as our firmware doesn't cause the hardware itself to violate FCC 
specs, we're in the clear. According to Snippet 1, it shouldn't even be 
possible to violate the specifications, but we all know how good 
manufacturers are at stuff like that ;P.
