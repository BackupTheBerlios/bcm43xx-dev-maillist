We didn't see the PHY transmission errors in b43 until fairly
recently. Unfortunately, they are too intermittent to tell if it is a
regression, and more importantly, it would be a bitch to bisect the
code as one would need many weeks of testing before saying that a
particular kernel was good.

When I first got 64-bit dma working on a BCM4311/2, there was always
one such error. That was removed when Michael changed the dma code.
Now I do not get any on most runs, but every once in a while (3 times
since July!), I get a storm of these.

Unlike most of you, I have seen the Broadcom code. There is almost no
error checking in their routines, which is good for us - it makes the
code smaller and the decompilation easier. I will never RE the binary
blob of the hybrid driver for a number of reasons; however, I doubt
that their culture has changed. As to why their driver has such poor
performance, your guess is as good as mine.

Which BCM43XX do you have? You need to open a terminal (in Linux),
issue the command '/sbin/lspci -nnv', and post the first 2 lines for
the section that describes your Broadcom device. If your device is
supported, the driver will be loaded automatically. That is the reason
the guide doesn't tell you to load a driver.

That's output produced by "lspci -nnv"

This is section talking about my broadcom device:

Filadelfo,

The 4328 chipset is not currently supported nor are any other N based
phy's. Work has recently begun to add support for N based devices, but
progress is slow since the specifications from the reverse engineering
have not yet been completed. For the moment, your only choice is to
try Broadcom's proprietary driver or use ndiswrapper. There has been
limited success with these approaches in the past. Your mileage may
vary.

Regards,

David Ellingsworth

Thanks for your information :( .

So I think I try ndiswrapper in the between .

Hello there.

I am having a similar issue to yours. My card is also a BCM4311 rev01 and
when I am at school, where I connect to multiple access points that have the
same ESSID (Campus-wide wireless network) the card keeps re-associating but
only in certain zones. My connection is flawless at home, on a WRT54G router
and at all the places where I connect to a single access point.

For example, where I am right now, my connection is pretty stable. In one of
my courses, it barely ever works.
Included below is the result of "dmesg | grep wlan0" after a 3h course in
the location where the connection barely works. Out of the 3h, I can use my
connection ~10mins.

Subject: b43 driver problems
Message-ID: <28d5a4330810011132o43c68257n203c3db030ea277@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

my b43 driver is not working for me, but it was, i dont remember, maybe
after the kernel upgrade or sth it stopped working, well it actually works,
i can search for networks, associate with them, but after few seconds or
minutes (usually when i try to access some web page) it disconnects. I dont
understand why.

I searched in forums and mailing lists for weeks and nothing helpes,
compiled kernel manualy and nothing, im in deep depression becouse of this.

below info about my system:

What distro and kernel are you using? If NetworkManager is available,
my experience is that it is more likely to reconnect.

If your kernel is "old", you may find that wireless-testing works better.

Looks like he's using 2.6.26.  I'm using 2.6.26.3 and having a similar 
problem.  I am using wiCD to connect with b43legacy.  I'm planning on 
updating to 2.6.26.5 tonight and see if that helps.  I just upgraded to the 
latest WiCD and need to test that out with my current kernel, before 
updating the kernel.  I'll let you know if that makes any difference.   It 
should be noted that I didn't have this problem before upgrading to 2.6.26.3 
recently.

I guess it was Larry who was talking about PHY transmission error few
days ago? Talking that this was introduced some time ago but it's
extremly hard to bisect as it doesn't happen often.

Vaidas, Kurt: do you get "PHY transmission error" on every disconnecting?

If you do -> Larry: wouldn't it be nice to try bisecting in this
situation, when they have PHY transmission error reproductable?

I may write something stupid however ;)

Guys, you are taking this way too seriously.
These PHY transmission errors are _harmless_. They don't cause any
breakage, if they only appear once in a while.
The message does only mean that we failed to transmit a packet.
That is not fatal. The 802.11 protocol does recover from it
without any problems.

I think we should probably silence the warning and only print it
when it happens like 20 times per second.

We have more important things to do than to waste our time on
a packet lost out of one thousand.

Michael,

On occasion, the PHY errors get much more serious. In dmesg, you get
the notation that 600 or 700 have been skipped. In addition, the
interface will reset.

I think that if anyone can reproduce these regularly, then bisection
is desirable. If it happens only once out of 20 boots, or more, then
skip it.

Larry

I get these errors every time i disconnect. Also after disconnecting I get
no results if I scan for networks, then i reload module and i can connect
again.

See, this is what I'm talking about. There's a lot of placebo involved.
There was no change to b43 in the .26-stable kernel. So it cannot regress
between .26.1 and .26.5.

Hi,

as I got comparable problems after upgrading the firmware, I attach the
mail I sent a while ago (to Debian bugs). The mail never appeared
on the list here (I was not supscribed). 
I confirmed this in the meantime with a more recent Debian kernel
(2.6.26) and got one response from a guy with the same
symptoms. Downgrading the firmware helped him too.

Bug#480053: b43-phy0 ERROR: PHY transmission error with firmware
version 410.2160

Andreas B. Mundt
Sun, 06 Jul 2008 00:26:13 -0700

Hi,

I already sent this message to [EMAIL PROTECTED], but got no
response yet. With the transition to 2.6.25 in testing it might be
important: 
 
Using firmware version 410.2160 results in massive problems with my
wlan card. The connection is established (WEP), but fails sooner or
later
(usually after a couple of seconds or minutes, not immediately, during
data transfer: 'b43-phy0 ERROR: PHY transmission error'). 
The card worked fine with firmware version 351.126.

Please find some more information below. If I can be of any help, let
me know. Thanks,

   Andi

So maybe something outside b43 has weird side effects. Maybe Mike 
tries 26.26.2, 2.6.26.3, 2.6.26.4 as well and tries to identify 
when the errors start to happen. The list of changes in the 
stable series is usually so little that this could give a hint.

Greetings;

I pulled out my lappy today and tried to get a connection in the garage, about 
55 feet and a layer of alu siding between the card in my dd-wrt based x86 
router with an aetheros wireless nic in it.  No dice, couldn't even get the 
radio's activity led to blink.

Brought it in here so the distance was maybe 4 feet, still deader that 4 day 
old roadkill.

Plugged in a cat5 and used that to google for b43.  Downloaded 2 files, one 
supposedly for <=2.6.26, and one for >=2.6.27.  But both output the same, use 
a legacy version with this kernel.  So I googled some more, and found the 
fwcutter for the 4.150.xx versions from broadcom.

Copy/pasted the stuffs from the web page to a shell, getting everything done 
without errors other than typu stuff.  Called up the f8 wireless tools and 
gave it the local security keys & told it to use the first profile.

'service network restart' brings up eth0 and the radio but doesn't get a path 
through the radio.  Unplugged the cat5 & restarted, got a path but it went 
down again.  I don't think NM was running cuz I shoot that puppy on sight.

Dragging out vim and fixing the ONBOOT in ifcfg-eth0 to no, and ifcfg-wlan0 to 
yes & putting a DNS=my router in ifcfg-wlan0, and one more network restart.  
It worked flawlessly.  Unlike a year ago when I needed this thing on the 
road, then I had to drag a 50 foot piece of cat5 everywhere I parked it to 
reach the local router of where ever I might have been. 

I have never made it work in that short a time before, by a factor of several 
days.  It Just Works(TM) and for a change, I'm a very happy camper, so 
obviously you all have been busy while the lappy was sleeping.

Again, many many thanks to all.

Subject: huge softirq while using wlan0
Message-ID: <1224376914.12407.59.camel@pc.ilinx>

Hi there,

I've got a Linksys WRT54GS loaded with OpenWrt's Kamikaze branch,
revision r12987.

I have configured the wlan0 interface to use WPA2 but I am finding that
traffic going through the wlan0 interface is killing the CPU on this
router with soft interrupts.  Here's what the top of top says while I'm
bulk transferring through the router:

CPU:   0% usr   0% sys   0% nice   0% idle   0% io   0% irq  99% softirq
Load average: 2.36 0.78 0.29
  PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %MEM %CPU COMMAND
    3     2 root     RW<      0   0%  57% [ksoftirqd/0]
  715     1 root     R     3932  13%  19% hostapd -B /var/run/hostapd-wlan0.con
  501     1 root     S     1968   7%  10% udhcpc -t 0 -i eth0.1 -b -p /var/run/

Effective throughput is only 1.4MB/s even though the client says it's
connected at 54Mbp/s.

Here's the dmesg output from my router:

I am noticing that last message and that is the MAC of the client doing
the bulk transfer.  I would have thought that that would be causing the
crypto to be getting done in hardware rather than software, although
that's a complete amateur's observation.

Any ideas why the softirq is so damn high?

Not yet.  I thought I would come to the source first.  The larger
concentration of experience with b43 is likely here rather than the
OpenWrt developers don't you think?

Wrong and wrong.  All built from source here.

Indeed, I can.

I may end up doing that.  My query here was merely to ascertain whether
what I am seeing is consistent with the current revision of the b43
driver or not.  I believe I am understanding that it is not and that
others are able to run the b43 driver in AP mode with WPA2 encryption
and not having the encryption done in software -- or have high level of
interrupts otherwise.

And you.

You've got the 2.6.25 code running with the latest firmware.  There have 
been some changes.
Can you try and pull the b43 code from the current 2.6.27.1 distro and 
see if it will run? 
There's also the wireless-compat tree, but I would try the vanilla 
2.6.27.1 tree first.

I think you're on the right track.  Just fyi (and please take this 
without insult) had you included your kernel (uname -a) as well as "I 
built this myself from source from XXXX") it would have made it easier 
to provide more useful suggestions in the first cut.

I think you can make it work.  The hardware DOES does do what you want.  
I suspect either b43 or mac80211 is not as up to date as it ought to be 
in your newly built kernel.

Others know more.  I'm just waiting for Shanghai F1 ;)

I don't think so. A lot of OpenWRT guys have a lot more experience
with b43 on SoC and in AP mode.

Hi.
Have you tried the new closed Broadcom driver?

Will it be any useful to you in reverse engineering of the Broadcom cards?

Will do.  I wonder what kind of incompatibilities there might be between
2.6.25.17 and the driver in 2.6.27.1 though.  I guess I can only find
out.

It is good to know that the concept at least is workable which was my

Yeah.  Perhaps.  I think my first posting was just to find out if what I
wanted to do was possible with the current code before posting all of
the details about my set up.  But your point is taken.

> I think you can make it work.  The hardware DOES does do what you want. 

Of course.  My question was more about the software.  Is it able to take
advantage of the hardware an so on.

I fixed the problem by passing -K to dhcpcd, 

 -K, --nolink
   Don't receive link messages for carrier status.  You
   should only have to use this with buggy device drivers or
   running dhcpcd through a network manager.

(I don't think it's an authentication / association problem, but
something else related to this "link message for carrier status",
specifically involving dhcpcd.)

Our reverse engineering efforts have been devoted to the MIPS versions of the

Would it be useful for me to mmio-trace that driver after I've upgraded to 
2.6.27? I was thinking about doing it, but I was looking for an opportunity to 
ask what you all wanted to see. ( I have a 4328 card ).

I've already sounded out the capabilities of the wl.ko driver, so here's what 
I plan to do as the test regimen:

ifconfig up
iwconfig mode managed
iwconfig mode ad-hoc
iwconfig mode managed
iwlist wlan0 scanning
Associate with open network
associate with wpa-psk (tkip) network
Scale through txpower settings
scale through rate settings
scale through sens settings
ifconfig down

Anything to add? I'm thinking of scripting it, so it'll just be a 
`sudo -s wireless-mmio-trace.sh`

Just to be clear, just linux-2.6.27.2/drivers/net/wireless/b43 together
with the rest of compat-wireless-2008-08-06 or is there more from
linux-2.6.27.2 that you think I should try to include?  I'm not terribly
(i.e. at all) clear about what the inter-dependencies are in this area.

I went with 2.6.27.2 since it's latest stable.  Let me know if you think
that's a mistake.

This did not help.

I tried building mac80211 from 2.6.27.2 against my 2.6.25.17 kernel but
it's not terribly compatible I'm afraid:

I have a WRT54GL v1.1 running latest Kamikaze in AP/WPA2 mode without
problems, I am able to transfer at 5.7Mbps from very far and 7.29Mbps
very close with iperf.  Simply amazing!  Kudos to the spec documenters
and to the driver writers!!!

> Any ideas why the softirq is so damn high?

I used to have the same problem with various APs in the place where I
work and it happens to be phisical problems, simply too many IRQs per
second as the card was forcing to much to TX, one case was the antenna
which somebody broke the connector and in other case (presumably) was
that the AP was too close to a big metal structure, when I move it away
to another location the problem went gone.

Kamikaze is in 2.6.25.17 (which you can easily patch to .18) but it
doesn't use the in-kernel mac80211 or b43 driver, both are compiled
"out-of-band" ie they pull from the wireless-tree, as I said in the
other mail b43 is working perfectly in latest Kamikaze, your problem
could be something phisical (location?).

First check the antennas and the location, if that  doesn't solve it
we could see other things.

Not for me. Once we have a reverse-engineered driver for the BCM4328, then a
mmio trace might be useful to locate RE errors.

Indeed.

Not here it isn't anyway, not on a WRT54GS.  I have had others confirm
my findings on the openwrt-users list but nobody claim to have it all
working perfectly fine.

> your problem

So you think that something "environmental" is responsible for the high
softirq that OpenWrt is clocking up?

> First check the antennas and the location,

Are you being serious?  You think that the antennas (i.e. not being
pointed in the right direction?) are causing high amounts of softirqs
and that if I fix the antennas, the softirqs will go away?  Can you
explain the technical details of how this can be?  I'm having a hard
time drawing a conclusion between high softirq counts and antennas.

> if that  doesn't solve it

I'm game.  I really doubt antennas, or anything else "physical".  I've
already successfully backported b43 from 2.6.27.2 and it did not solve
the problem.  Unfortunately mac80211 will not backport so easily.

Well, there is certainly one easy way to rule this sort of problem
out... would you be willing to share your .trx or .bin firmware blob?

FWIW: my AP and the wireless client are two feet away from each other.

For me works perfectly, even injection and fragmentation under
aircrack-ng works stable (but needs 2 extra patches).

It's not necessary, kamikaze is using the correct mac80211 for 2.6.25
(compat-wireless-2008-08-06).

Well, it's not a problem for the Linksys or Tomato firmware.  Why should
it be a problem for b43?

You never answered my request for a copy of your working OpenWrt
firmware.  That would be the most straightforward way to eliminate all
these non-quantifiable variables.

Tomato with the proprietary bcm-wl driver under 2.4 kernel have enough
differences to Kamikaze with the b43 driver under 2.6 kernel enough to
investigate if the TX power differs and if it is causing RF saturation.

I think your worst problem is that you don't have an open mind to debug
all the possibilities, I was just trying to help you solve your problem
but with that attitude is really hard.  I administer like 150 WRTs and
belive me the most insignificant and obvious problem is your worst
enemy.

I just can share you my pwnx0r edition which I use at the University
(where I'm the sysadmin) to pen-test our networks.  This version differs
slighty with Kamikaze HEAD in that we use the 2.6.25.18 kernel instead
of the 2.6.25.17 and the 2 extra patches from aircrack-ng, one for the
mac80211 to support fragmentation and the other to b43 for speeding the
injection.  Beware this version doesn't have a DHCP server and is
filled with penetration software.

http://home.galileo.edu/~solca/openwrt/openwrt-brcm47xx-pwnx0r.trx

I just test it with a WRT54GSv3 and it works correctly too.

If you want really rock solid stables APs suitable for production
environments you should go with my custom firmware patch:

I noticed that lspci returns
10:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4310 USB Controller (rev 01)
on my HP 550 (FS325).

I guess it's just not-yet-supported LP PHY device as mentioned on

USB device... right?

So is this entry in PCI ID repository invalid? Can someone fix it?

Ah, that's probably because of old database in openSUSE 11.0:

I still have the same problem here as well... except that I just went to 
2.6.27.2 and still get the same problem.  Last night, it seemed like my 
laptop (with 4306 using the b43legacy driver) actually took down my entire

What does "laptop actually took down my entire wireless network" mean?
Does it mean that nothing could connect to your network?  That sounds 
more like an AP issue to me.

--- Actually, it means that while I was using my laptop, at the time it lost 
connection and I tried to reconnect (through WiCD), my playstation 3 
wireless link and my iMac wireless link was lost until I "killall wicd"ed on 
my laptop.  My wired link did work (checked on my home server linux machine 
running Kubuntu), so I don't think it was my access point, per se.  But, as 
I said, it all could have been a coincidence.

-- It was trying -- nice pun -- I went through a lot of things (like 
reconnecting -- going back to knetworkmanager--, upgrading wicd, changing 
wifi channels), and think it's the "newer" driver for b43 legacy.

Well, it would be interesting to see a wireshark log of another device in
monitor mode while this happens. Additionally a spectrum analyzer log
would be pretty cool.

If you wanted to go over the specific suggested setup for wireshark, I'd be 
happy to implement it.  I don't know wireshark, so if you could eliminate 
the learning curve, I'd be happy to take the data.

Just setup your testbed like the time you noticed the bug.
Now add an additional machine, put it into monitor mode and
let wireshark listen on the channels where the bug happens.
Reproduce the bug now.

Hi Michael,

I tried the updated firmware. For me there are even more PHY
transmission errors, but: the connection does not fail anymore as
before (see my mail a few days ago). Partial dmesg below.

Thanks,

If anyone else is having troubles with this, can you try something for me?
As su, do an ifconfig and see if you're running ipv6.  I disabled it by 
modifying modprobe.conf.local,
and it seems like I can now stay connected.

If anyone else is having troubles with this, can you try something for me?
As su, do an ifconfig and see if you're running ipv6.  I disabled it by
modifying modprobe.conf.local,
and it seems like I can now stay connected.

Well, it would be interesting to see a wireshark log of another device in
monitor mode while this happens. Additionally a spectrum analyzer log
would be pretty cool.

I still get PHY TX errors with the new firmware. But I didn't notice any
regressions with the new firmware.

Subject: b43 fails to reauthenticate
Message-ID: <200810291836.29795.aleks@fys.uio.no>

  Hello all,

 Sorry if I'm writing to wron mailing list. From my uneducated point of view it looks like problem in driver
but I may be wrong.
 I'm having following problem. Wireless card of my laptop associates and authenticates successfully with 
access point. After some time of successful usage (5-10 minutes) AP sends deauthentication with reason 
code 2, which AFAIU is "Previous authentication no longer valid". Sometimes reson code is different (I saw 
3 and 23) but mostly it's 2. Then card reassociate and reauthenticates succesfully and gets deauthentication 
immediately. And then it runs like that in loop forever. Card is controlled by wpa_supplicant and if I kill it (ifconfig 
shows that interface is down after that) and then restart wpa_supplicant card connects to AP successfully. Below 
are technical details.

WPA configuration:
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0
eapol_version=1
ap_scan=1
fast_reauth=1

network={
  scan_ssid=0
  ssid=".........."
  proto=WPA
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
  pairwise=CCMP TKIP
  group=CCMP TKIP WEP104 WEP40
  psk="............"
}

network={
  ssid="any"
  key_mgmt=NONE
  priority=2
}

The you need to find out why the AP does this in the first place.

So, the above entry is strange. If you know the network/AP, you 
can do an "iwlist eth1 scan" and fill in pairwise/group 
accordingly. Usually they're both identical. As you 
have "proto=WPA", you should normally then have pairwise=TKIP, 
group=TKIP. CCMP is used with proto=WPA2 (or proto=RSN, which is 
the same).

And that's even more strange, an entry for something that 
shouldn't exist: an open, unencrypted, unprotected wireless 
network ...




Some things that might help you: Try "wpa_cli" and it's "status" 
and "level" commands. Make sure that no other external programs, 
e.g. Network-Manager, is responsible. Look with "ps faxwww" at 
the command line arguments for wpa_supplicant. Then kill it, do 
an "ifconfig XXX up" (name of the interface) and start 
wpa-supplicant by yourself, but this time without the "-B" 
(background) option, but with one or two "-d" (debug options).
