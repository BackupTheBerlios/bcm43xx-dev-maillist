It is also frustrating to have put as much effort into a project as we have and then get the kind of 
backbiting that you are exhibiting!!

The only two fixes that will have any future are (1) get bcm43xx-softmac switched over to mac80211 
(which I am working on) or (2) fix bcm43xx-mac80211. We are not spending any time on SoftMAC. It is 
gone as soon as either of the steps above are working well enough.

Don't give me that SH*T about how much you have on your plate. In the past, I have dropped 
everything to help you get bcm43xx working. Obviously, that was a bad decision on my part. I should 
have just let you use ndiswrapper!!!
