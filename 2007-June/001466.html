<PRE>I've been alternately switching between 2.6.22-rc3 (Linville git tree) 
and 2.5.22-rc6 (Linville git tree as of today), henceforth rc3 and rc6 
respectively.

I've been alternately switching between bcm43xx and bcm43xx_mac80211, 
henceforth soft and hard respectively.

About the only thing I've found &quot;strange&quot; that I hope someone else can 
confirm, is that running a tcpdump simultaneously with the DHCP client 
causes more success than failure.

Oh yeah, here's another aside.  My DHCP server is actually an Adtran 
Netvanta 1224STR, so it is kind enough to supply debugging messages.

When running rc3 hard, here's what I see
dhclient -&gt; reports it's asking for an address
tcpdump -&gt; shows the bootpc request
router -&gt; shows it received the request and sent back a reply
otherpc-running-tcpdump -&gt; shows the reply coming back
tcpdump -&gt; never shows the reply coming back!!!
tcpdump -&gt; shows 802.1d and other frames coming from the router
dhclient -&gt; times out

So clearly the router and the laptop ARE successfully exchanging 
traffic, but yet for some reason the laptop is not seeing the bootps 
reply on the initial request under rc3 hard.

If I had to do a matrix it would look like this:
rc6 hard - works but stuck at 1Mbps
rc6 soft - works
rc6 hard - unable to communicate, but associates fine
rc6 soft - works

More data follows.  I hope some of this rings a bell in someone's mind.  
If anyone wants me to do testing, I'm in that mood again, and I've got 
2.6.21 (F7), 2.6.22-rc3(linville) and 2.6.22-rc6(linville) all ready to go.

OH YEAH for full disclosure... my kernel is tainted by the Nvidia module...

Ehud



rc6 and hard works but not very well.  the rate is stuck at 1Mbps, and 
dhcp client only works if I simultaneously open a tcpdump session on 
that interface. 
eth1      IEEE 802.11g  ESSID:&quot;wetwork&quot; 
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.437 GHz  Access Point:

          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

that's hard mac 1 meter away from the access point.

Note that the driver will not allow me to set the rate... says that's 
unsupported.

Here's what the kernel spit out:

rc3 hard does not work at all in the sense that both dhcp fails, and 
setting a hard address fails to successfully communicate.

rc3 soft works tho:

          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

NOTE: the softmac driver will allow me to change rates.
