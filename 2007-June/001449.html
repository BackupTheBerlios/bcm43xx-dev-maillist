My situation is that I don't use &quot;iwconfig eth1 key open&quot; initially.
The interface goes up and works enough time for dhclinet to get an
address.  Then it's stops working, although iwconfig still shows the
association.  And then &quot;iwconfig eth1 key open&quot; restores the connection
permanently.

It's one of those little irritating bugs in softmac.  Other little bugs
are incorrect display of ESSID when the interface is down and duplicate
packets when pinging another station connected to the same AP.

Oh, another one is that the code becomes confused when it re-associates.
It sends packets to the new AP through the old AP.  Maybe you have an
open AP around?  Then I suggest that you set ESSID before bringing the
interface up to avoid reassociation.  And please don't be surprised if
ESSID looks a bit too short before the interface is up.

Anyway. maybe you have something different.

It's quite frustrating to have two drivers for the hardware, one of
which is pretty bad with the 802.11 implementation, and the other cannot
setup the hardware (although I need to give bcm43xx_mac80211 another
try).  Both should be fixable.  I just need to get some other stuff off
my plate first.
