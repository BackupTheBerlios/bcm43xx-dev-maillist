Yeah, I think that's very wrong.

</I>
Even then, if the AP is just in range it might not receive transmissions
at 54M, depending on the fallback mechanism that might or might not be
ok.

&gt;<i> it

</I>
The thing about 802.1X is that you have a handshake with a few packets
that need to go through or you need to restart, which is the wpa problem
people are seeing currently with bcm43xx, but my brother also sees with
madwifi/atheros in our living room upstairs (router is downstairs here)

&gt;<i> If this low rate were to be set for all drivers, how rapidly would the rate-control algorithm

</I>
This, unfortunately, I don't know. I'd think the algorithm would adjust
fast enough for it not to be an issue.
