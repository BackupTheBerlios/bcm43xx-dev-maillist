I have problems like that with my 4319. Been meaning to debug and
provide output. Although I believe it's party or entirely due to my use
of softmac still. Which seems to be deprecated in favor of an
alternative these days.

Anytime my laptop is up an running. If I lose wireless for what ever
reason. I have to rmmod and modprobe usually a few times to get my card
to properly reset and come back up. Every now and then a reboot, and I
can always get it to come back on reboot. But who has time for a reboot
much less it not being the cool thing now days ;)

It makes connecting to a new wap, or say finding/using an open one a
complete PITA. One of my longest standing gripes. However considering a
year ago it knew nothing about my driver. And for the first few months i
had to modify stuff so it would see and active my card with mac and all.
So just been pleased for it to be working at all over the past year.

But running at 11mbps is getting old. Finally got that up to 22mbs, but
nothing beyond. Much less the driver issues with restarting that network
interface or etc and having to unload/load the driver repeatedly.

Will see if I can debug a bit this week and provide more useful info.
Other than confirmation from another of a similar or related problem :)
