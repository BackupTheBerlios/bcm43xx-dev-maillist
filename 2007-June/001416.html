<PRE>Hi.
I have a 4311 on a Gateway MX6447.  I am running 64studio, an offshoot of
Debian.  I downloaded kernel 2.6.21 and patched it to 2.6.22-rc4 (for my
soundcard), copied the configuration, and made sure all the bcm43xx options
were selected.  I compiled the kernel, installed bcm43xx-fwcutter, and ran
it on wl_apsta.o from <A HREF="http://boredklink.googlepages.com/wl_apsta.o">http://boredklink.googlepages.com/wl_apsta.o</A>

I entered my wep code and was online for a while.  I had added Debian
unstable to my repositories, and did an update/upgrade, and immediately
after it finished the wireless went down.  However, I doublechecked that
bcm43xx and /lib/firmware weren't involved in any of the upgraded packages,
and the kernel is still my custom kernel.  The network dialog still shows
eth1 active, still shows the list of APs, and still has the passcode;
&quot;iwlist eth1 scan&quot; still shows a list of APs, including mine.  The access
point was showing as invalid, but after I turned the radio LED off and on,
it showed as an address.  I've rebooted the system a few times, rechecked
everything.  Still no errors, still shows as connected, but nothing
received.  I did try &quot;modprobe bcm43xx&quot; just in case, no difference.

I did try re-cutting the firmware, and now &quot;bcm43xx-fwcutter /lib/firmware
./wl_apsta.o&quot; says that wl_apsta.o has an invalid checksum; however, when I
checked the sum under Windows, it told me a different number than what
fwcutter said.

Can anyone help me?
-Chuckk
