<PRE>Hi.
I worked through some things with Ehud, but it was inconclusive.  I just
recompiled using the advice at
<A HREF="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-547687.html">http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-547687.html</A> as far as kernel options,
and I did this with the 2.6.22-rc4 patched kernel, and uname -r indeed tells
me 2.6.22-rc4_etc.
eth1 will scan, picking up several APs, and the command &quot;iwconfig eth1 essid
&quot;frank&quot; key blahblahbl&quot;, after doing it twice, does cause a valid access
point in the output of &quot;ifconfig eth1&quot;.  The network GUI dialog shows the
available ap's, several of them, and shows eth1 as being active and the WEP
key is in and everything.  Yet the command 'dhclient eth1' still tells me
the network is down, and I still cannot access the internet.

Previously I had eth1 up and running, and as soon as I did some stuff with
Synaptic (GUI for apt-get), it went down and wouldn't come back.  Then I
tried sitting next to the box, plugging in to check Ehud's replies and
unplugging to test eth1, and after I installed a chess program - nothing
else - with Synaptic, then suddenly the ethernet wouldn't work either.
I since compiled the kernel with more of the options from the link above,
and still nothing.

Can anyone help me?

Thanks.
-Chuckk
