Larry, it must be a misunderstanding.  I realize that softmac is not
your code.  You are doing a great job.  I only regret that I don't have
time to make patches for softmac, so that your driver can work better.

&gt;<i> The only two fixes that will have any future are (1) get bcm43xx-softmac switched over to mac80211 
</I>&gt;<i> (which I am working on) or (2) fix bcm43xx-mac80211. We are not spending any time on SoftMAC. It is 
</I>&gt;<i> gone as soon as either of the steps above are working well enough.
</I>
That's all great, and I don't want to discourage you from that.  I was
just trying to help somebody who is using the driver with softmac now.
Maybe it was just a coincidence that I started hitting various softmac
bugs as I saw that e-mail.

&gt;<i> Don't give me that SH*T about how much you have on your plate. In the past, I have dropped 
</I>&gt;<i> everything to help you get bcm43xx working. Obviously, that was a bad decision on my part. I should 
</I>&gt;<i> have just let you use ndiswrapper!!!
</I>
I only mean I regret that I cannot accompany my complains with patches
right now.  Although I think I should.

I do appreciate your help.  I absolutely didn't mean anything bad
towards you or the approach you are taking.

Perhaps I should keep my frustrations to myself.  Sorry if I offended
you.
