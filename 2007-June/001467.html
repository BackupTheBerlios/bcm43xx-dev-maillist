There have been significant changes in bcm43xx_mac80211 in its own git
repository (<A HREF="http://bu3sch.de/git/wireless-dev.git">http://bu3sch.de/git/wireless-dev.git</A>), which improved
things a lot.  As far as I know, the changes are not in 2.6.22-rc6 yet,
or you would have seen a backtrace.

There is nothing specifically &quot;hard&quot; in mac80211.  You may need to use
another convention.

I understand you mean tcpdump on the same machine as the driver.  I
think I may have seen it.  Perhaps the promiscuous mode would speed up
recalibration, or something like that.  Anyway, the current git version
of bcm43xx_mac80211 is working much better and should not need such
tricks.

&gt;<i> If I had to do a matrix it would look like this:
</I>&gt;<i> rc6 hard - works but stuck at 1Mbps
</I>&gt;<i> rc6 soft - works
</I>&gt;<i> rc6 hard - unable to communicate, but associates fine
</I>&gt;<i> rc6 soft - works
</I>
You may want to use another convention for kernel versions as well.
They look too similar to me.

I hope you understand you cannot reuse this key after having exposed it
in a public forum.  On the other hand, WEP is considered generally
unsafe these days, so it's more an polite request to leave your network
alone than actual security.
