This is likely a problem with Gentoo. I use openSUSE with NetworkManager with a BCM4311 and WPA-PSK 
TKIP encryption, but I have also used it with WEP. When I boot, it connects automatically at least 
90% of the time. For the others, I only have to click on the NM applet to connect.

Are you sure the WEP key has been entered correctly? WEP has the unpleasant habit of not informing 
anyone that the key was wrong. You need to get the hex key that your AP is expecting (not a 
passphrase) and enter it.
