<PRE>As the son of a physicist and someone who appreciates GOOD DOCUMENTATION 
OF A PROBLEM AND SOLUTION I have to echo Larry's kudos.  This was a 
well-documented analytical approach to solving the problem.  Undoubtedly 
since the world is not perfect and we must deal with $40 APs we'll all 
see this at some point or another :)

Thanks!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems. I make no claim for originality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My HP Pavilion dv9012 series laptop with internal BCM94311MCG wlan
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mini-PCI card has worked flawlessly with VISTA, SuSE SLED10, Dapper, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fiesty. When I upgraded to Gutsy, downloaded the Restricted Firmware,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and went on-line it worked immediately but Download speeds ran from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 20kbs to ~ 60kbs. This, with a DSL broadband line rated and tested for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7Mbs. I communicated with others via this and other Forums, and also did
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many Google searches attempting to resolve this problem, but to no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avail. Finally, I was able to locate the cause and corrective action
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary to restore full 7mbs speeds by means of a systematic debug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process which worked, and is 100% repeatable. My apologies in advance to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the BCM43xx development group who were both helpful, and had the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patience to stick with me, as the problem had nothing to do with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Firmware.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To isolate the problem Vista was run on this dual-boot laptop, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also contains Gutsy. The BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI performance was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> identical to that of Gutsy. Conclusion: could be a defective BCM94311MCG
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wlan mini-PCI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Next I used a Thinkpad Laptop (Dual-boot) running Xp and Fiesty. Results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were identical, low-speed identical to that above, but with Totally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different hardware; ie, it does not use a BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> card. Conclusion: The BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI card and the firmware
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for same is not the problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Next step was to disconnect my internal Linksys router from my internal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Network, then connect directly to my DSL Modem via Ethernet cable to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HP Laptop. Result was full DSL 7Mbs speed. Conclusion: problem must be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> associated with the Linksys wireless &quot;B&quot; Broadband router. The Internal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Network could not be the problem as it was previously checked for up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 100Mbs transfer rates.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Linksys router was next tested by bypassing the wireless part and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connected to the Laptop via Ethernet cable. Result: Full DSL 7Mbs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performance. Back to square One!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To finally isolate where the Linksys problem was, everything was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reconnected to it's initial state, rebooted and speed retested. It was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unchanged at 20kbs to ~ 60kbs data rate. Using a wired connection to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Linksys router was still a full 7Mbs rate.  Conclusion: The Linksys
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> router in the wireless mode is clearly the problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally,  the Linksys router was given a Full reset. The procedure to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setup from scratch was followed to completion by re-entering all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary information as necessary for operation with the DSL modem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Result: Problem solved. Full wireless operation with my HP Pavilion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dv9012 and the BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI, now produces the identical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7Mbs data rate as the DSL Modem itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How the Linksys Router lost it's mind is unknown, as it is on an active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UPS system. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry for the long-winded update, but systematic thought processes are a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary attribute for a Physicist! After nearly two weeks of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intermittent investigation I felt compelled to tell someone!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You did a good job of analyzing the problem. As a retired physicist and a former reviewer for Phys.
</I>&gt;<i> Rev., I have to ask &quot;What was the model and version of the Linksys wireless router?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These consumer-grade access points sometimes lose their minds for no reason. Usually a reboot or
</I>&gt;<i> reset is all that is needed, but I have one Linksys BEW11S4 Ver. 4 that would not connect at all. It
</I>&gt;<i> started working when the firmware was reflashed. The strange part is that the &quot;new&quot; version was
</I>&gt;<i> identical to the &quot;old&quot; one.
