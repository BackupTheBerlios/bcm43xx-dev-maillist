I can answer this question. During the creation of b43legacy, it took a lot of time (2-3 weeks
full-time) to marry the PHY and radio code of bcm43xx to the main parts of b43. Now most of the work
consists of taking the patches to b43 that are generated by Michael and porting them to b43legacy.
This often entails a bit more work than blanket substitutions of &quot;b43legacy&quot; for &quot;b43&quot;, but these
changes do not happen very often. The remaining part of the work is to verify that changes to
mac80211 and other parts of the kernel have not broken b43legacy. The job is definitely a part-time
one. I think it should not take more than 3-4 hours per week.

Although I have resigned as maintainer, I am not leaving the project entirely. My situation is that
I will not have access to a broadband connection for 3-4 months, and will have to rely on dial-up
over a shared line. I will be able to do E-mail, but not kernel updates. I will certainly help you
in any way that I can.

Larry
