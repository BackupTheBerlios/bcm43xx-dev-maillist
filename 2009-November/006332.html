 &gt;&gt;    Thanks for the tip. But it still hangs
 &gt;
 &gt; We still need to know where it hangs. If you boot to console mode 
(type a 3 on
 &gt; the option line in GRUB), does it boot? If it does not, what is the 
last line
 &gt; shown on the console? If your distro shows a splash screen while 
booting, get
 &gt; rid of it by typing an ESC after booting starts, or eliminate the
 &gt; &quot;splash=silent&quot; option on the boot line.
 &gt;
 &gt; If the previous boot works, log into your usual account. That should 
still work.
 &gt; Next you should type the command startx and immediately press the keys
 &gt; CRTL-ALT-F10. That is hold the CTRL and ALT keys while pressing the 
F10 key. The
 &gt; display should shift to the log console. When the computer freezes, 
report what
 &gt; you see on the screen. It will not scroll, nor can you save it. Write 
it down by
 &gt; hand or take a picture.

  Sorry for not giving the details. I'm using Fedora 11 with 2.6.32-rc7 
kernel. I've turned of the splash screen and boot into runlevel 3. The 
last line I see is that the distro tries to start up udev -- No oops or 
such thing.

I also did the following -- (1) removed the whole /lib/modules/XXX/ tree
and booted into the kernel. (2) Made &quot;make modules_install;depmod -a&quot;.
If I do a &quot;modprobe b43&quot; it still freezes without any further message.
Surprisingly if I only remove b43.ko from the module tree it still hangs
on reboot. Looks like a &quot;inter module&quot; problem to me. The only other 
modules I hold are arl1.ko, atl1e.ko,atl1c.ko mii.ko and 
scsi_wait_scan.ko but the only one being loaded seems to be atl1c.ko


I actually do not have any firmware installed yet and I had a look at
the code ( also I'm not a kernel hacker) and I see that it should bail
out properly if it fails to find (and|or) initialize the firmware. So it
seems to fail quite early.

There used to be a kernel option that makes it extra verbose. What was 
that ?

Thanks

Sebastian

 &gt; Report what happens. If some of these steps don't work on your 
computer, please
 &gt; tell what distro you are using.
