I agree that the new code makes a lot of sense. I'm also beginning to believe
that the problem lies outside b43, and that it is merely triggered by some
interaction with ACPI and/or the BIOS. From what I found in looking back through
the DMA error reports, most (if not all) people with the problem have netbook
computers with Intel ATOM processors.

I am considering posting on LKML and the ACPI mailing lists to see if we can get
any ideas from those experts. Please comment on the draft text below:

============================

A number of users are experiencing DMA descriptor or data errors using 64-bit
DMA with the Broadcom BCM4312 wireless device. After careful review and a
rewrite of the DMA code in the driver, we have not been able to fix the problem,
but we have determined the following:

(1) The problem is much more likely to occur on netbook systems. Several of the
developers have this card in regular notebook systems. None of us have the
problem, thus it may occur only on netbooks, but several brand/model
combinations are affected including Dell Inspiron 910 and Acer Aspire One A150.

(2) If CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR is not set on affected systems, the error rate is
much lower.

(3) When a DMA descriptor error occurs, a dump of the descriptors does not
reveal any obvious problems.

I do not know enough about either the ACPI or DMA code to begin debugging in
either of those regions. Any suggestions on debugging strategies, or links to
similar problems would be appreciated.
