This patch definitely helped open-source firmware, but it is not a complete fix.
Usually, a failure occurs within minutes to a few hours under heavy load. For my
system, the load is repeating tcpperf transmits in one terminal, and a flood
ping in a second. This time, the system ran for ~25 hours before failing. After
removing the header to eliminate wrap-around, the messages logged are:

These messages continued. Unloading and reloading the driver restored the network.
