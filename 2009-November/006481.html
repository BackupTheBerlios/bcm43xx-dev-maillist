</I>I did tried before, it succesfully built, it was loading (modprobe)
correctly but no new interface was registered by it.
However, I might have done something wrong, I will try it again to make
sure it wasn't a PEBKAC problem.

</I>Right. Do you have a link to this patch? I would rather avoid
downgrading my kernel.
