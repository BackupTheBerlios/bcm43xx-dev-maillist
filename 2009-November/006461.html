It is no fix _at_ _all_.
The patch does not change a single line of code that wasn't either an assertion
or a machine crash before.
So it just transforms assertions into more verbose assertions and crashes into
assertions without a crash.

&gt;<i> debug: Out of order TX status report on DMA ring 1. Expected 114, but got 146
</I>
Ok, this is what I expected.

Let's see what's going on. Here's the ring. o is unused, * is used.

ooooooooooooooo***************************************************ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
               ^               ^                                 ^
               114             146                               newest
               oldest

So as you can see, the firmware reported a TX status for a frame right in the middle of
the ringbuffer. The new code detects this now before getting a double free and/or silent
memory corruption (freeing of used memory).

It really is illegal to report a TX status for a frame that's not the oldest one in the ring.
The firmware is required to process all frames in-order on one ring.

So how can this failure happen? I think there basically are three ways this can happen.

- First is that the ordering within one ring really gets messed up and it loses track
  of its ring pointers. I'm not sure if this is likely. Probably not.
- It messes up the ring membership. So it reports a TX status on the wrong ring.
  Note that the &quot;ring&quot; kernel pointer in the TX status report handler is derived
  from the cookie (and so also the number in the message &quot;Out of order TX status
  report on DMA ring 1&quot; is derived from the cookie). So it's untrustworthy in case of
  broken firmware. The firmware has QoS-alike mechanisms, even if QoS is disabled. Maybe
  these mechanisms are broken.
- Third is the possibility of a driver bug. I rule that out as long as nobody is
  able to reproduce it with proprietary firmware.
