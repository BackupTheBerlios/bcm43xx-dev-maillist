Please note that nobody suggested to use &quot;fwpostfix&quot; in order to support
regular migration from a kernel version to another one. That was proposed
as a convenient way in order to switch back and forth between two kernel
versions.

Did anybody ever complain about ipw2200 very frequent firmware changes
between kernel versions (i.e.
<A HREF="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/firmware.php">http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/firmware.php</A>)? This would be the second firmware change for bcm43xx/b43.

Please also note then that having b43-fwcutter to rename firmware
according to its capabilities could be disruptive too (as people already
have a lot of fun by downloading unsupported firmwares, and this would
just confuse the users even more). A big fat printk that tells the user that
the firmware found in /lib/firmware is unsupported and displays a
linuxwireless.org URL seems the best solution to me. But again, Michael
wasn't even talking about one particular implementation, he just wanted to
warn in advance about a likely firmware change in the future.

I know that distros out there are having even more fun than users in
messing up this sort of things, but this can't really be claimed to be our
fault.
