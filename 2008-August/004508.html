<PRE>Hi, all. Sorry if this has been discussed before, but I checked the
archives and couldn't find anything.

I just found out that Broadcom released an official Linux driver:

<A HREF="http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php">http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php</A>

Now, the license it's under is fairly obviously not F/OSS (besides, it
comes with a binary blob), so it's not going to kill b43 or anything. I
don't know how *good* it actually is, I haven't tried it yet.

However, the real point that occurred to me is firmware. Presumably,
this thing has firmware in it somewhere. Has anyone considered whether
we could extract the firmware from this for use with b43, rather than
from the Windows driver?

The license this driver is under is not F/OSS, but it's not as
restrictive as the license on the Windows driver. It explicitly allows
redistribution, in unmodified form. So it wouldn't be okay to extract
the firmware from this driver and just package that, but distros *could*
package the entire driver (without ever actually using it) and then
automatically extract the firmware from it when setting up b43. This
would finally solve the Firmware Minefield issue caused by distros not
being able to ship firmware for b43 in any way.

Has anyone looked at this? Is it possible? Am I way off base? :) Thanks!
