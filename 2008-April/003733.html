Tested on this:

b43-phy0: Broadcom 4306 WLAN found
b43-phy0 debug: Found PHY: Analog 2, Type 2, Revision 2
b43-phy0 debug: Found Radio: Manuf 0x17F, Version 0x2050, Revision 2
phy0: Selected rate control algorithm 'pid'
Broadcom 43xx driver loaded [ Features: PMLR, Firmware-ID: FW13 ]

It's actually Fedora development kernel 2.6.25-0.195.rc8.git1.fc9.i686
with patched compat-wireless installed.

It's working better than I could possibly expect.  The range is on the
par with another laptop with ipw3945 running Linux or Windows XP.  It's
working through 4 walls and 30 meters on top of that.  I understand that
there are many random factors involved, but my impression is very
positive.  Basically, it's good enough to go outside with the laptop
without having an AP installed near a window.  I haven't seen any
significant interruptions in the connection.

Unfortunately, I hit that nasty circular lock dependency bug (already
discussed in another thread) when I killed wpa_supplicant to try another
AP.  The CPU utilization went to 100%, but the driver kept working.

Another unrelated bug (sorry, testing often finds unrelated bugs) is
that scanning with specific ESSID was returning non-matching APs.  I
mean &quot;iwlist wlan0 scan my_essid&quot;, which would still report many
different ESSIDs.  It's inconvenient when the driver can sense 22 APs at
once :)

I'll try to get 4318 tested over the weekend.
