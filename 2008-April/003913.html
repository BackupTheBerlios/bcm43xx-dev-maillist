Yes.

+Usage
+-----
+
+The contents of the sprom are exposed to the user in sysfs. This
+tool can, in principle, read and write the sprom in place; however,
+making a mistake during sprom writing could render your device
+unusable. For this reason, we recommend copying the sprom contents
+to disk as the first step. This copy can then be modified until it
+contains the desired new information. Only then and with caution
+should the sprom be rewritten. DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES UNLESS YOU
+KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!! You have been warned!!!
+
+Obtaining a disk copy of the sprom contents
+-------------------------------------------
+
+This file name for the sprom contents depends on the bus layout of
+the specific computer being used and will be something cryptic like
+
+/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/0000:01:00.0/ssb_sprom
+
+It is not recommended that you try to type the name. Instead, you
+should use the following commands to get the working copy:
+
+SSB_SPROM=$(find /sys -name ssb_sprom)
+sudo cat $SSB_SPROM &gt; ssb_sprom_copy
+
+Modifying the contents of the working copy
+------------------------------------------
+
+You may now look at the contents of your sprom with the command
+
+ssb-sprom -i ssb_sprom_copy -P
+
+As an example, let us suppose that you have purchased a Dell mini-pci
+card to use in an HP laptop. The HP BIOS refuses to use the card when
+the pcivendor is Dell (code 0x1028), not HP (code 0x103C). From the
+dump above, we learn that the pcivendor code is a 16-bit quantity
+stored at 0x06. To change that code, we use the commands
+
+ssb-sprom -i ssb_sprom_copy -o ssb_sprom_copy -s 0x06,0x3C
+ssb-sprom -i ssb_sprom_copy -o ssb_sprom_copy -s 0x07,0x10
+
+to write the two bytes separately. The documentation implies that
+these data could be written as a single 16-bit quantity; however,
+that doesn't work at the moment.
+
+Once you think you have updated correctly, use
+
+ssb-sprom -i ssb_sprom_copy -P
+
+again to check the contents.
+
+Rewriting the sprom contents
+----------------------------
+
+Once the sprom contents are the way you want them, and presumably
+correct, you are ready to rewrite the file. If you have logged out
+since the working copy of the sprom contents was obtained, the symbol
+containing the location of the file in sysfs will have been lost. In
+any case, it is safe to reload that symbol again with
+
+SSB_SPROM=`find /sys -name ssb_sprom`
+
+You are then ready to rewrite the sprom with
+
+sudo cp ssb_sprom_copy $SSB_SPROM
+
+Once again, you are urged to be absolutely certain of the contents
+of the working copy BEFORE taking this step. If your interface
+becomes unusable as a result of writing incorrect data into the
+sprom, the responsibility is YOURS. Once again, you have been warned.
