<PRE>Hmm... There's a misunderstanding somewhere.

My laptop appears to be a real nightmare. I've spent too much time
hacking the DSDT, having TuxOnIce work (yes, I would also like to test
Nigel's git tree if I had time), getting around various hardware and
BIOS bugs, etc.
I'm tired of updating the kernel so often.

Exceptionally, I could find time to build a wireless-testing kernel if
it's just to test it for a few minutes, but I don't want such a kernel
for work. I have the feeling your patch needs to be used for quite a
long time.

I didn't wrote I would wait this patch to be in a stable version.
It is to late for your patch to be present in 2.6.25, isn't it?
2.6.25 will be released very soon and your patch can be used on it, am I
wrong? If not, I'll wait 2.6.25 to test it.

JM
