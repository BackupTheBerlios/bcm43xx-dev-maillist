<PRE>That sure sounds more likely to be related to fixing the problem.  How do I 
see your changes and know where to change the source code I have to test it 
out?

Regards,
Kurt

it could actually also be a bug in the code that sets TX power. I reviewed
that in b43 a few months ago and found lots of bugs. In particular the 
scaling
algorithms were wrong. One might want to port the stuff from 
b43_phy_xmitpower()
over to legacy.
The old code turned out to interpret the estimated TX power in a wrong way 
and
based the actual attenuation calculations on that. The attenuation 
calculations
were also wrong. I rewrote them and put them into a seperate function that's
called from b43_phy_xmitpower().
You might start with adding a few printks into the code and see what the
estimated TX power value actually does. If it bounces heavily, it's clearly
wrong.
It should only have a hysteresis of 0.5 to 1 dB.
The idle-tssi value is also a major parameter for TX power, so you might 
also
check
if that's right.
