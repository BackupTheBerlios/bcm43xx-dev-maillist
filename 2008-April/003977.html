That part is not too difficult to understand. When the commit was made
in February, it was to the wireless-testing tree for inclusion in
2.6.26. Only when Linus went to the 2.6.25-git kernels in the process
of getting to 2.6.26-rc1 did that commit make it to mainline.

Do you have the ssb and b43 debug info from one of the &quot;bad&quot; kernels?
Please post that info from /var/log/messages. It seems as though this
problem shows on your system because you have a multi-band device.

I'm glad that the RF switch is now behaving properly.

Thanks,

Larry
