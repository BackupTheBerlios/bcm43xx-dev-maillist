Oh, wasn't meant like this. :)
I just wanted to say that you're most likely not going to find the bug
this way. :)

&gt;<i> I have to be

</I>&gt;<i> to the contents of the SPROM, or even the radio used by the chip, how

</I>
Well, the SPROM code was completely rewritten and the radio code was
partially rewritten. So there's enough room for bugs. :)
There are several SPROM values that affect TX heavily.

Do you have a WLAN spectrum analyzer btw? Can you test whether there actually
is a signal produced by the card?
I hope that my card will arrive soon, so I can test this as well...
