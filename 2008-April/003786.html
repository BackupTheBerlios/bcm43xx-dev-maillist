<PRE>I'm chasing a subtle bug and it takes it time to manifest, so the whole 
git bisect process will likely take days.

The symptoms are that &quot;after some period of time&quot; the machine loses IP 
connectivity.  I add detail below.  It can
be restored through either of the following:
1. NetworkManager click on the network.  It disconnects and reconnects 
and works for a while.
2. modprobe -r b43 &amp;&amp; modprobe b43.

During the time of the symptom, iwconfig shows strong connectivity.  
dmesg shows nothing unusual or strange.
The wlan0 network monitor shows RECEIVE and transmit increments.

Wireshark shows broadcasts from the Adtran router that talks to the WiFi 
router on the wired network, so definitely
wireless connectivity is there, and definitely wired from there.  It 
shows ARP requests from the laptop that are
never responded to (although the STP packets from the device that ought 
to be responding are received just fine.)

Wireshark on the wired LAN fails to see the ARP requests at all.


After a reset the Wireshark on the wired LAN can again see the ARP 
requests (and everything works).

Does this ring any bells for anyone on anything that's changed in the 
last week?  I took a quick look at the differences
between the two source trees and there's a lot there (mostly the PIO+DMA 
changes).

SO yes, I'm doing a git bisect.  It just sometimes takes hours to 
manifest...

Ehud
