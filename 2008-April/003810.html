I am using a WPA2/AES+PSK based network. Where the AP is located approx 
15ft away. This device when running under Mac OSX runs perfectly fine. ( 
I haven't tested Windows.

Ah, the second well only this that came after was &lt;6&gt; (sometimes &lt;7&gt;) 
and this confused me as it didn't appear immediately, just the next time 
I checked dmesg. (I actually thought it was some outer glitch as it 
appeared right after the &quot;size&quot;)

&gt;<i> It any case, &quot;wrong buffer size&quot; doesn't seem to be considered a major

</I>
Ah ok, so I guess that isn't enough!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you should describe what you see after it happens, the output of

</I>
I haven't noticed any more kernel messages so far, and I have 
re-compiled the b43 module with the DEBUG flag.

Next time it reproduces I'll get some more info from the cli tools.

Normally in order to re-associate with the AP I issue the following:

/etc/init.d/net.wlan0 stop &amp;&amp; modprobe -rv b43 &amp;&amp; sleep 1 &amp;&amp; modprobe -v 
b43 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/net.wlan0 start

And it re-associates quickly. If I don't unload the driver and reload, 
there is not a chance to get it to re-associate.


Cheers,

Dan.
