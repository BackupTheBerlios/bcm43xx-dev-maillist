In a previous post, you gave the following output:

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/bcm43xx-dev">richie at laptop</A>:~$ lspci -vv -d :4312
01:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11a/b/g 
(rev 01)
          Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Unknown device 1361
          Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- 
ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
          Status: Cap+ 66MHz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=fast 
 &gt;TAbort- &lt;TAbort- &lt;MAbort- &gt;SERR- &lt;PERR-
          Latency: 0, Cache Line Size: 64 bytes
          Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 19
          Region 0: Memory at b3000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) 
[size=16K]
          Capabilities: &lt;access denied&gt;

Did this come from your computer? If so, the PCI information is that 
it is as 4312, but the chip id, which is what b43 prints out, 
identifies it as a 4311. Curious.

I have no idea as to why the interface is switching from 5 to 2.4 GHz, 
and back endlessly. Perhaps Michael knows. It is also possible that 
the bug is in the new mac80211 band API, which isn't used by b43 when 
the &quot;bad&quot; commit is backed out.

The patch contained in 
<A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2008-April/007423.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2008-April/007423.html</A> 
should fix the PHY transmission errors, at least it fixed the one that 
was thrown by a BCM4311/2.

BTW, a patch to fix the LED configuration was submitted earlier today 
on the linux-wireless mailing list. It should fix the problems you had 
in getting the proper config.
