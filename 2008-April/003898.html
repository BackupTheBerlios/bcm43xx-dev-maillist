&gt;<i>     Hi All! Been trolling for couple months trying to
</I>&gt;<i>     learn...just when I think I know what to do &amp; in what
</I>&gt;<i>     sequence you guys change everything!
</I>&gt;<i>     I've an HP Pavilion dv9310us w/bcm4311 rev 2 mini-pci.
</I>&gt;<i>     temp dual-boot xp(sp2)/opensuse 10.3. works on
</I>&gt;<i>     xp(ugh!) did work on suse for 2 weeks, added security
</I>&gt;<i>     &amp; other patches, hasn't worked since. kernel:
</I>&gt;<i>     2.6.22.17-0.1-default
</I>&gt;<i>     Prefer operate linux exclusively, but many probs
</I>&gt;<i>     w/ndiswrapper, if-iw/config and other stuff. really
</I>&gt;<i>     need wireless access so I can learn remote admin of
</I>&gt;<i>     tux servers, config, etc.  course is avail &amp; free, but
</I>&gt;<i>     i'm not up to recomp of kernel and/or reverse eng.
</I>&gt;<i>     just yet. Anybody got a step-by-step for a n00b that
</I>&gt;<i>     isn't convoluted?? Maybe now there is a pkg or util
</I>&gt;<i>     which auto-magics??
</I>
You need to formulate your questions very carefully. For most people 
that read this mailing list, English is a second (or higher number) 
language. Sentences that look like the ones they learned in class are 
a lot easier to understand.

That said, I am writing this note on an HP notebook with a BCM4311/2 
card and running openSUSE 10.3. I am NOT using ndiswrapper, and have 
not used it for a long time. I am also not running the standard 
openSUSE kernel. The standard 2.6.22 used in 10.3 does not work with 
the BCM4311/2 cards, but 2.6.25 does.

If you can follow simple instructions, then you can recompile the 
kernel. It is not rocket science or brain surgery! To do so, follow 
these &quot;simple&quot; instructions while logged into your normal 
(unprivileged) account - DO NOT DO THIS AS ROOT:

1. Download the 2.6.25 kernel source (linux-2.6.25.tar.bz2) from 
kernel.org into your home directory.

2. In a terminal window, unpack that source with 'tar jxvf 
linux-2.6.25.tar.bz2'.

3. Change directory to linux-2.6.25 where the sources were just unpacked.

4. Get your current configuration with the following commands:
    cp /proc/config.gz .
    gunzip config.gz
    cp config .config

5. With the YaST Control Center, make sure that you have installed the 
following packages: gcc, qt3_devel, and make.

6. From your terminal in the linux-source directory of step 3, enter 
'make xconfig'. If it reports any missing stuff, add it as in step 5. 
Once the GUI comes up, go to Networking/Wireless and make certain that 
&quot;Generic IEEE80211 Networking Stack (mac80211)&quot; is selected as a 
module (has a dot). Make sure that &quot;Enable LED triggers&quot; is checked. 
Deselect &quot;Generic IEEE80211 Networking Stack (DEPRECATED)&quot; - no dot or 
check. Next select Device Drivers/Silicon Sonics Backplane and make 
certain it has a dot and that SSB debugging has a check. Now select 
Device Drivers/Network Device Support/Wireless LAN. Make certain there 
is a dot in the box for &quot;Broadcom 43xx wireless support (mac80211 
stack), and that there is a check in the box for Broadcom 43xx 
debugging. Do a save, and exit the GUI.

7. From that same terminal enter 'make' to build the kernel. With this 
configuration, a lot of modules that you don't need will be built, but 
deleting them is advanced material.

8. When step 7 completes without error, issue the following command:

sudo make modules_install install

9. The above will prepare the new kernel for booting. To use it, use 
the normal command to restart the system and select the new kernel 
with GRUB.

10. The final step will be to down;load and install the firmware as 
described in 
<A HREF="http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#firmwareinstallation">http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#firmwareinstallation</A>
using the instructions for the &quot;bleeding-edge b43 driver&quot;.

11. Use the YaST Control Center/Network Devices/Network Card to 
configure the device. Under the &quot;Global Options&quot; tab, select 
NetworkManager. All other configuration will be done with the NM applet.

 From this point it will work.
