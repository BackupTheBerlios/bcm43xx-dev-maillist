</I>Thanks :)

FYI I didn't manually do anything for the sample I submitted.  In that 
one I simply used NetworkManager and it &quot;just Connected&quot; and never did 
anything else.

In previous tests I'd eliminated NetworkManager by manually setting the 
ESSID and WEP key*.  Since that made no difference I went back to NM. 

Again, thanks for the quick response, and the quick fix :)

Ehud
* I know I put my WEP key out there, but I firmly believe if any of my 
neighbors read this list they are more than welcome to associate with my 
APs.  (Or if they come up and ask me what the 4ft dish is all about...)
