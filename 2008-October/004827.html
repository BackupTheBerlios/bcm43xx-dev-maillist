<PRE>I still have the same problem here as well... except that I just went to 
2.6.27.2 and still get the same problem.  Last night, it seemed like my 
laptop (with 4306 using the b43legacy driver) actually took down my entire 
wireless network.  It could have been a coincidence, but it was trying.

I've seen this message a couple of times -- I'm a bit surprised that
you haven't been getting a response.  I am Cc'ing Michael and the
bcm43xx mailing list just in case they haven't noticed this message.

 &gt; The story is...
 &gt;
 &gt; I've moved from 2.6.25.x using BCM43XX with a Broadcom 4306 (rev3) 802.11
 &gt; chipset to 2.6.26.6 using the B43 and appropriate firmware. This on a 
COMPAQ
 &gt; Presario R3000 P4 and  a gig of memory and ATI graphics.
 &gt;
 &gt; I followed the install (upgrade) directions at linuxwireless.org. Piece 
of
 &gt; cake! However... I find that I've gone from &quot;bulletproof&quot; BCM43XX wifi
 &gt; connections to &quot;bullethole&quot; connections with B43.
 &gt;
 &gt; Under the old BCM43XX the handshake and connections were flawless and
 &gt; unfaltering. Now with the new B43, handshakes with AP's are perfect, but 
the
 &gt; connections randomly and silently fail. There are no debug messages, no
 &gt; complaints what-so-ever in /var/log/messages...
 &gt;
 &gt; To gt wireless back, I have to reinitialize the connection. I've gotten 
so
 &gt; good at it, that I can recite by heart the appropriate commands...
 &gt;
 &gt; It's killling me! I've got to get this ironed out... it's not just my 
laptop,
 &gt; it's happening quite regularly with people I know with similar chips and
 &gt; laptops.
 &gt;
 &gt; Trying 2.6.27-rc's and now 2.6.27 and the situation is no better.
 &gt;
 &gt; So I ask... Who is the B43/B43LEGACY maintainer and would you be 
interested in
 &gt; debugging this mess? I'll bend over backward to help you... Email me
 &gt; direct... I'm very willing.
 &gt;
 &gt; SHORT STORY:
 &gt; -- Kernel 2.6.25.x with BCM43XX, firmware 4.80.53.0.. just perfect.
 &gt;
