<PRE>Greetings;

I pulled out my lappy today and tried to get a connection in the garage, about 
55 feet and a layer of alu siding between the card in my dd-wrt based x86 
router with an aetheros wireless nic in it.  No dice, couldn't even get the 
radio's activity led to blink.

Brought it in here so the distance was maybe 4 feet, still deader that 4 day 
old roadkill.

Plugged in a cat5 and used that to google for b43.  Downloaded 2 files, one 
supposedly for &lt;=2.6.26, and one for &gt;=2.6.27.  But both output the same, use 
a legacy version with this kernel.  So I googled some more, and found the 
fwcutter for the 4.150.xx versions from broadcom.

Copy/pasted the stuffs from the web page to a shell, getting everything done 
without errors other than typu stuff.  Called up the f8 wireless tools and 
gave it the local security keys &amp; told it to use the first profile.

'service network restart' brings up eth0 and the radio but doesn't get a path 
through the radio.  Unplugged the cat5 &amp; restarted, got a path but it went 
down again.  I don't think NM was running cuz I shoot that puppy on sight.

Dragging out vim and fixing the ONBOOT in ifcfg-eth0 to no, and ifcfg-wlan0 to 
yes &amp; putting a DNS=my router in ifcfg-wlan0, and one more network restart.  
It worked flawlessly.  Unlike a year ago when I needed this thing on the 
road, then I had to drag a 50 foot piece of cat5 everywhere I parked it to 
reach the local router of where ever I might have been. 

I have never made it work in that short a time before, by a factor of several 
days.  It Just Works(TM) and for a change, I'm a very happy camper, so 
obviously you all have been busy while the lappy was sleeping.

Again, many many thanks to all.
