Not yet.  I thought I would come to the source first.  The larger
concentration of experience with b43 is likely here rather than the
OpenWrt developers don't you think?

&gt;<i> The standard b43 has no issues with it, but I have no idea which version

&gt;<i> From the firmware rev I suspect it's not a fairly recent one meaning 
</I>&gt;<i> the codebase isn't the newest either.
</I>
Firmware appears to be from broadcom-wl 4.150.10.5

&gt;<i> In any case, you're on an embedded device running a kernel you didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> compile
</I>
I sure did!

&gt;<i> and whose version you don't mention
</I>
2.6.25.17

&gt;<i> and a driver you didn't build in an environment which I'm guessing you 
</I>&gt;<i> also don't build.
</I>
Wrong and wrong.  All built from source here.

&gt;<i> Let me know if I've erred on any of my assumptions.
</I>
As above.

&gt;<i> For instance if 
</I>&gt;<i> you're able to build your own drivers and install
</I>&gt;<i> them on that Linksys, or if you're able to build your own kernels that 
</I>&gt;<i> work on that Linksys, those would be two good things
</I>&gt;<i> to know.
</I>
Indeed, I can.

&gt;<i> If not, talk to OpenWRT.
</I>
I may end up doing that.  My query here was merely to ascertain whether
what I am seeing is consistent with the current revision of the b43
driver or not.  I believe I am understanding that it is not and that
others are able to run the b43 driver in AP mode with WPA2 encryption
and not having the encryption done in software -- or have high level of
interrupts otherwise.

&gt;<i> Regards and a good weekend to you, sir,
</I>
And you.

Cheers,
b.
