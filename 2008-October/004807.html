I can try...

Will do.  I wonder what kind of incompatibilities there might be between
2.6.25.17 and the driver in 2.6.27.1 though.  I guess I can only find
out.

&gt;<i> You are correct.
</I>
It is good to know that the concept at least is workable which was my
goal.

&gt;<i> I think you're on the right track.  Just fyi (and please take this 
</I>&gt;<i> without insult) had you included your kernel (uname -a) as well as &quot;I 
</I>&gt;<i> built this myself from source from XXXX&quot;) it would have made it easier

</I>
Yeah.  Perhaps.  I think my first posting was just to find out if what I
wanted to do was possible with the current code before posting all of
the details about my set up.  But your point is taken.

&gt;<i> I think you can make it work.  The hardware DOES does do what you want. 
</I>
Of course.  My question was more about the software.  Is it able to take
advantage of the hardware an so on.
