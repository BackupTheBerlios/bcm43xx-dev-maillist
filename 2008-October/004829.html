</I>--- Actually, it means that while I was using my laptop, at the time it lost 
connection and I tried to reconnect (through WiCD), my playstation 3 
wireless link and my iMac wireless link was lost until I &quot;killall wicd&quot;ed on 
my laptop.  My wired link did work (checked on my home server linux machine 
running Kubuntu), so I don't think it was my access point, per se.  But, as 
I said, it all could have been a coincidence.

&gt;&gt;<i>It could have been a coincidence, but it was trying.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes you are very trying but what does it all mean?
</I>-- It was trying -- nice pun -- I went through a lot of things (like 
reconnecting -- going back to knetworkmanager--, upgrading wicd, changing 
wifi channels), and think it's the &quot;newer&quot; driver for b43 legacy.
