<PRE>Otto, Thanks for the response.  Unfortunately, my only other available 
machine is a windows XP machine.  Therefore, I am not able to do an ifconfig 
to monitor the interface. Sorry, I should have emphasized that more in 
previous emails (although I did mention it was a windows machine).  So... 
you're right, I'm better off not trying to help out and let you developers 
continue to do what you're doing.  Good luck.

Kurt

 &gt; looking forward to SOME kind of directions for use from you.

Kurt,

What Michael was suggesting you is that _you_ intercept the packets as
they travel in the air when the bug is being reproduced.

It can be done in several ways, I suggest you:

1. Find another box (laptop) with WLAN adapter supported under Linux.
2. Put the above WLAN adapter in monitor mode, same channel as your
network:
    # iwconfig &lt;iface&gt; mode monitor channel &lt;channel&gt;
3. Capture the packets:
    # tshark -n -i &lt;mon_iface&gt; -s 65536 -w /tmp/capture.dmp
4. Reproduce the bug or error in the original box.
5. Upload the capture.dmp file somewhere and post the URL here.

If you can't do this simple steps please find your way somewhere else
and come back when you're ready with a capture file.

-otto
