No, there are more of them. Most bytes in config space are rw, except
the first four.


&gt;<i> &gt; Should I conclude that someone zeroed this area?
</I>
No, because there are still valid bytes. Especially the first byte in
the BAR being non-zero (maybe even unchanged) is peculiar.


&gt;<i> Yeah well. I'm not sure. It _looks_ like someone completely cut the
</I>&gt;<i> physical power line to the card and it reset its complete PCI
</I>&gt;<i> config.
</I>
PCIe maps config space into MMIO IIRC. It might be clobbered that
way.


&gt;<i> So well, X does poke with the PCI devices. But as you said it also

</I>
Agree.


&gt;<i> But I would not rule out a fucked BIOS, yet.
</I>
Possibly.


&gt;<i> Does the BIOS have any powersave options and/or spread-spectrum
</I>&gt;<i> options for the PCI-bus? Can you try to turn them all off?
</I>
Being a HP I don't expect there are many options in the BIOS. :\


&gt;<i> &gt; In case the kernel memory diagnostics don't help, is there any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way to trap writes to the configuration registers?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if we have random memory corruption, that can hit memory and MMIO.
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't hurt to turn on all debugging options. Often you get some hint
</I>&gt;<i> by doing so.
</I>
I hope this will give some more info. I think it will.
