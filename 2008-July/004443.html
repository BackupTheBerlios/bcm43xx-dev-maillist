I don't use Fedora and have no idea what the state of the b43 driver is in 
either of those kernels. From what I read, the development kernels (rawhide?) 
are the closest to wireless-testing, which is the state of the art for wireless. 
You should ask questions about the kernels on Fedora's forums.

</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I think b43legacy is the track this chip should be

</I>
As was pointed out earlier, you do not select whether your chip runs b43 or 
b43legacy. It is the 802.11 core revision that counts. Just for your info - if 
you had a BCM4306 revision 2, it would use b43legacy. Your system selects b43 
because you have a BCM4306 revision 3. Do not mess around with b43legacy and/or 
the firmware in /lib/firmrare/b43legacy. It will not matter!!!

I suggest using NetworkManager to operate your wireless device, rather than 
using ifconfig directly. I also suggest that you use DHCP rather than a fixed 
IP. It is altogether too easy to mess up your routing tables and your DNS server 
entries with fixed IP.

&gt;<i> b43-phy0 debug: Found Radio: Manuf 0x17F, Version 0x2050,
</I>&gt;<i> Revision 2
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a regression with 2.6.25? 
</I>
No, the revision level that really counts is that of the 802.11 core that is 
read by ssb.
