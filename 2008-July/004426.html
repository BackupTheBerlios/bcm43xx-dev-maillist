<PRE>(originally sent July 12 from a different mail addy, apparently the mail didn't make it then, but I got a copy back.. also I see at least one message didn't get delivered to me from berlios)

---8&lt;---[snip]-----

I've been unplugged for a few days now with everything b43 related working great, then today I put away the laptop for a few minutes, and when I came back the signal appeared to be lost. Knetworkmanager indicates that no network is present by showing the unplugged icon. Also it shows no scan results.

dmesg shows that I disabled radio (attached), but I didn't, and the led tells it's active. There is no reaction whatsoever when switching on and off.

Also lspci shows a borked output:
01:00.0 0280: 14e4:4312 (rev ff) (prog-if ff)
        !!! Unknown header type 7f

Kernel is a stock ubuntu 8.04:
Linux laptop 2.6.24-19-generic #1 SMP Wed Jun 18 14:15:37 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux

The computer had gotten through about 5 suspend/resume cycles before the above happened.

After a soft reboot the card behaves again. If you think I left out some information, feel free to flame me  :) 

Unless this issue appears again, I will not persuade it further. But if you want me to test something I'll gladly help.

regards / Richard
