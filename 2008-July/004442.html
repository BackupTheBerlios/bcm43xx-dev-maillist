You mean it doesn't work after reboot?

You should not be able to use b43 and b43legacy with the same device.
Perhaps you patched one of those drivers to support your card?  Then
please be specific.

</I>
What matters is the 802.11 core revision reported by the ssb driver when
SSB debugging is enabled.  b43 doesn't report it.  Perhaps ssb is too
quiet without debugging.

</I>
I have a bcm4306 card with the same PHY and radio, and it's supported by
b43 only.  b43legacy can be patched to support it.  I have no problems
with that card, even with reboots.

Fedora is known to pull some experimental stuff into its kernels.
Anyway, it's not the latest Fedora kernel, please upgrade if you can.
And all real wireless work is done on the wireless-testing kernel.

dhclient on Fedora brings the interface down briefly.  b43 is very
susceptible to disassociation if it happens (but sometimes the
connection survives).  A workaround it to avoid dhclient.  If you have
to use it, you'll need to set essid in another session while dhclient is
waiting, or run &quot;wpa_cli -i wlan0 reassociate&quot;

It is a known problem, but I think dhclient is entirely to blame.
Bringing the interface down goes well beyond the &quot;zone of
responsibility&quot; of dhclient, as it affects the lower layers that need to
stay connected and keep their state.
