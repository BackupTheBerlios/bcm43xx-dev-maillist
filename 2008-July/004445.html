It seems to work here. The dmesg output for my BCM4312 is:

Is this sufficient, or is there other output that you want to see?


&gt;<i> But please note that current wireless-testing tree seems to have some
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated TX issues in mac80211 (see the discussions about the qdisc
</I>&gt;<i> and skb-&gt;cb stuff.)
</I>
AFAIK, this particular bug is limited to mainline. At least wireless still works 
in wireless-testing, but fails completely in Linus's tree.
