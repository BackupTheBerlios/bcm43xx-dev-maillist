<PRE>I sent this earlier before being subscribed. I am sending a 
revised version again with latest developments.

I said:

I seem to be only able to get a bcm4306 chip to work when I power
on, but powering on does not seem to be a sufficient condition
for it to work. I am wondering if powering on after some time off
is necessary and sufficient?

This is with 2.6.25-14.fc9.i686  or 2.6.25.10-86.fc9.i686.

And I can only get this result with 4.150.10.5 firmware.
With 3.130.20.0 firmware, ie b43legacy. after associating with
the AP, it disassociates with reason=3. That is, it
disassociates of its own accord.

That is, I haven't been able to get it working with 3.130.20.0.

I wasn't able to get 4.80.53.0 working either, though I haven't
tried as much.

Actually, I think b43legacy is the track this chip should be
working with, rather than b43, because I think it has a 'MAC core
revision' of 2, ie less than 4.

b43-phy0 debug: Found Radio: Manuf 0x17F, Version 0x2050,
Revision 2

Is this a regression with 2.6.25? 

I'm going to show you the [relevant] output of dmesg after the successful session, and then an unsuccessful session immediately afterwards, after releasing the dhcp lease.

I will show you the output with the b43legacy driver if you want to see it.

The successful session with bcm4306 (note this is 1 of 3
successful sessions over 18 hours of struggling with it. All of
the above statements I am unconfident about :)

After powering on:

Then the unsuccessful session immediately afterwards:

The output of dmesg appears to say it successfully associates
with the AP, as before, but then right at the end, Interface
type 2 is removed and the Wireless interface stopped.

But read on!

The output of uname -a and lspci -vvn are th e same for this
unsuccessful session as for the successful session.

Subsequent to writing this I read 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2008-June/007647.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2008-June/007647.html</A>
about problems with dhclient.

I am now using a fixed IP address, and I also turned off Fedora's 
NetworkManager.

But I don't have b43legacy driver installed. (I believe if I delete 
/lib/firmware/b43legacy and rmmod b43legacy, the b43legacy driver 
will not be installed.)

Now I can bring the wireless card up at will.

The releavant parts of dmesg are:

b43-phy0: Broadcom 4306 WLAN found

This ouput is the same as the successful session with dhclient 
after first boot in the morning.

I am using this wireless card on a non-roaming desktop with no 
other machines on the LAN, so I am happy with using a fixed 
address and not using NetworkManager.
