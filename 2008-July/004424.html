Some recent HP laptops had a bug in the BIOS that did not run the fan 
aggressively enough, the motherboard overheated, and the PCI interface to the 
wireless card failed. It happened to me with the computer under warranty. While 
it was in for repair, HP suddenly recalled it and mine was replaced with the 
model that was roughly the same cost. After a year, that meant 1 GB RAM =&gt; 3, 
120 GB hard drive =&gt; 250, etc.

I think it is likely that Compaq models also had the same problem. How old is 
the unit? If not under warranty, I would bitch to Compaq - the squeaky wheel 
might just get some grease.
