<PRE>Not sure if it's related, but I have read somewhere that 4318/02 requires
wl_apsta.o when using fw4.80.53, it doesn't work with wl_apsta_mimo.o from
the same package. Maybe it would be a good idea to add support for the new
wl_apsta.o (as opposed to wl_apsta_mimo.o) to fwcutter (or make fwcutter use
search-and-cut instead of hardcoded offsets, making it compatible with
future firmware files). Possibly wl_apsta_mimo.o still doesn't support
4318/02.

Um... not really. WL-138G V2 includes a hardware limit that prevents
switching to forbidden channels. Regardless of REGDOM, you won't be able to
switch to channel 14 (except maybe if you hack the SPROM, possibly the HW
regulatory domain setting is stored there, but it might also be embedded on
the chip) on a non-JP card. Not sure about other 4318/02 brands though. (I
suspect that this hardware lockout is the one that conflicts with mac80211,
although it might be unrelated, as I got this error on the wireless-testing
tree with an RalinkTech 2573 AKA RT73 USB dongle as well.) Possibly USA
versions don't have this lockout, but EU versions do. (Even the old bcm43xx
gives &quot;Operation not permitted&quot; regardless of REGDOM for iwconfig &lt;card&gt;
channel 14.)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Someone from the USA should confirm, this looks more and more like a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mac80211 bug. (Note: my AP is on channel 1, so it's not in the EU-only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; range.) Also, are there any records of an EU 4318/02 user getting b43
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to work? Japan might also be of interest. Someone should also try
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loading mac80211 (or cfg80211 on the wireless-testing tree) with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ieee80211_regdom=64 to see if that helps. (I can't, as my OpenSUSE box
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; died.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You currently can't use channels 12/13 with mac80211, but that shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> matter if your AP is on channel 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I suspect that if the card has a hardware-level 13-channel limit, then
mac80211 doesn't work with it at all, regardless of channel. It receives,
but doesn't transmit, maybe a safety feature in the hw/fw to avoid
transmitting on disallowed channels.
