So, why don't you collect that info, verify it and put it into the wiki?

I have plenty of 4318s working.

i386 and powerpc.

We are not even sure yet that it's the _card_ that makes it fail.
It could also be the architecture.

&gt;<i>      Sure, a quick check of the bcm43xx-dev-mailing-list will have them discover

</I>&gt;<i>      things like this - they'll just go to the website, see that bcm4318 is 
</I>&gt;<i>      supported and working and expect things to work...      
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So, your question is 'how can we add a warning about something we don't

</I>&gt;<i>                                    with this particular brand/model of card. See the

In general such warning messages tend to live forever.
We still have people telling others that we have TX power issues. The actual issue
is gone for a long time, but still people think it's there.
That's the reason why I do _not_ put such warnings on the page. As removing them
again (from peoples heads) is impossible.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; The driver does not work on x86_64 with IOMMU. That's because the IOMMU
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code is broken. (not a b43 bug)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ....Yes, this machine is an AMD64 (AM2 x2) setup --- I'll hunt down 
</I>&gt;<i> the exact kernel param to boot with and get back to you with any results... 
</I>
Thanks.

PS: Could you please hit the return key at about 80col?
It's painful to quote your posts.
