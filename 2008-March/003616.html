Greetings again,


....and the plot thickens....

  .....I was already thinking like Larry's posting, about how much I could actually trust this so called 'softAP' mode of the XP - asus driver&amp;management suite, so probably right about the time Larry was typing that down, I'd concluded to buy a wireless router/AP instead, and help remove any doubts here...thus, what I've ended up with is a Netgear WGR614 r7 device, and it appears to work 'as expected' out-of-the-box. I dialled in the same WLAN params I've been using thus far, into the netgear wap, hit the apply button...amble into my son's XP box, change from 'softAP' to 'infrastructure' mode..and after XP thought about it some, the wifi connection came up, worked, inet connectivity and all....
                                ....[and just as quickly a few minutes later, it all fell on it's face....apparently that XP box has some contention over who is handling the wifi connection, 'windoze zero config' or the asus config manager]...but I managed to shut one of them up, and it worked....


..Meanwhile, back at this linux box, I'm in a different situation again...now I know the hardware actually works, that my configurata was valid input..and that there no love|hate war between asus cards and netgear waps...at least,this is what XP exampled. The linux side of the fence looks different but nowhere near sane ;


wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:1B:FC:61:15:E1
          inet addr:172.16.1.234  Bcast:172.16.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:894 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:54238 (52.9 KiB)

...that zero RX packet has got to be a worrying field. If it is to be believed, it'd certainly explain why I can't ping anything, anywhere with tcpip on wlan0...

...I'd be fairly sure that I shouldn't see this either ;

wlan0: authenticate with AP 00:1e:2a:61:7d:2c
phy3: TX to low-level driver (len=30) FC=0x00b0 DUR=0x013a A1=00:1e:2a:61:7d:2c A2=00:1b:fc:61:15:e1 A3=00:1e:2a:61:7d:2c
wlan0: authenticate with AP 00:1e:2a:61:7d:2c
phy3: TX to low-level driver (len=30) FC=0x00b0 DUR=0x013a A1=00:1e:2a:61:7d:2c A2=00:1b:fc:61:15:e1 A3=00:1e:2a:61:7d:2c
wlan0: authentication with AP 00:1e:2a:61:7d:2c timed out

....on the other hand, if RX packets = 0 on the interface and that's true, then I probably would expect to see something like that...

Strangely, turning encryption off altogether in the AP itself and the linux setup here, made absolutely no difference apart from the fact that you then don't get debug messages about authentication attempts and failures.....and this make me think it's not authenticaion/encryption, seeing as the use (or not) of such security measures makes absolutly no difference to the tcpip layer - it seems dead. AFAICT, the radio (wireless) layer is doing all the right things, and the tcpip networking &amp; routing&gt;should&lt; work, but and alas nothing happens...in fact, I doubt I've see ANY count on RX packets on wlan0 ever....

One other curious thing -- if this machine is at 172.16.1.234 and the wireless AP is at 172.16.1.1 and I try to ping that end address across wlan0, the ping command itself performs very slowly, and I'll have to send it several rapidfire ^C breaks to get it to return. It might take it up to 10second to release and give me my prompt back, but in doing so it reports that it only got around to sending 3 packets in 10-15seconds worth of realtime - this is fairly bizarre behaviour, and no..there's no firewall in anyone's way.....

   So...does anyone have any suggestion? Before I start c&amp;p attachments willynilly, what in particular does anybody want to see? Or what path should I take to find out just what's going wrong here?

       I'll just keep poking it with a stick and hope it gets as mad at me, as I am with it (;

                           
                                                 Regards,

                                                               Donald
