....Faith? No, seriously....point taken, but we do know -something- ...ie; as you indicated earlier, a few people have reported this problem before..not just me, and so even though we don't know exactly why it is so or which hardware combination(s) exhibit this behaviour....(yet!).....we&gt;do&lt; know that -some- examples of bcm4318 based wireless PCI LAN adapters...particularly the asus WL-138G V2....suffer from this problem in some hardware setups.

   Do we know if anybody out there has this card working 'as expected' yet? If so, what hardware setup are they using? .....

     My point is, anyone going to the b43 website would be forgiven for presuming that this card *does* work with the b43 driver, because nothing says otherwise. Sure, a quick check of the bcm43xx-dev-mailing-list will have them discover otherwise...(and if they knew this aforehand they'd probably AVOID buying one of these card types in the first place)....but *most* people don't do things like this - they'll just go to the website, see that bcm4318 is supported and working and expect things to work...

    So, your question is 'how can we add a warning about something we don't know?' Well...in the supported/unsupported section of the b43 website, you could include a paragraph like this ;

                                   Note that some users of the b43 driver code are reporting issues with some (not all?) bcm4318 based hardware implementations. In particular, the ASUS branded cards, model WL-138G V2, are being reported as not working by a number of users, but as yet we are unsure as to exactly what is causing this problem, or in what specific hardware combinations the problem manifests itself. This issue is being actively investigated and hopefully will be resolved in the fullness of time, but for now 'your mileage may vary' with this particular brand/model of card. See the bcm43xx-dev mailing list archives for more...   


.....like that...


&gt;&gt;<i> just backtrack all this on the 32bit P4 box to make sure the situation with that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> older slower hardware....and I guess it's off to the computer shop on tuesday to buy some different cards...

</I>&gt;<i> Are you running on x86_64?
</I>&gt;<i> Can you try booting without IOMMU support?
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's the commanline option iommu=0 or iommu=off or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The driver does not work on x86_64 with IOMMU. That's because the IOMMU
</I>&gt;<i> code is broken. (not a b43 bug)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
....Yes, this machine is an AMD64 (AM2 x2) setup --- I'll hunt down the exact kernel param to boot with and get back to you with any results...


                                  Kind regards,
                                                        Donald
