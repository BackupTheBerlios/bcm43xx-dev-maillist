You are right. I retested just with the queue wake patch, and it does seem to 
reconnect as well.
I am not sure why it didn't work before - I probably applied it to the first 
version that broke (after bisecting) instead of wireless-testing, or I simply 
didn't wait enough time. Sorry about that - bisecting, compiling, rebooting 
etc. can get really confusing at times (especially late at night...).

Please let me know if you have any othes patch ideas for me to try.

I just upgraded to the latest firmware, but there is no change. I am not 
having any issues with this router while running 2.6.29 on this machine, or 
2.6.32 on another machine (using rt2x500pci). The router is Netgear WGR614V9, 
and the firmware is V1.2.24_37.0.35.
Also note that this &quot;reason 3&quot; only occures after the first association - 
after that it just continues with the &quot;no probe response&quot; I got used to.
