The BIOS is rarely if ever involved in any of this.

As was already explained, the rfkill signal is an electrical input to
the wifi hardware, and the b43 driver can only ever read the state of
this input.

Who drives the signal depends on the unique system design. (Think
mainboard.)

In laptops there is always at least one &quot;embedded controller&quot; AKA EC
which handles some or all of keyboard, GPIO signals, LEDs, Fn keys,
lid switch, power switch, special function keys, fan control, battery
charging and various other bits and pieces of the system.

Bytecode within the ACPI tables in the BIOS may be executed by the
kernel in order to discover e.g. Fn+key combination presses or lid
switch, but the BIOS does not have anything to do with changing the
electrical signal going out from the EC - that is done either by the
EC firmware (in response to some keypress, which will also be
reported via ACPI so the OS can update some status display) or as
ordered by the operating system (in response to some keypress
reported by the EC via ACPI).

There is no standardization at all for these signals and this
behavior. If you can find the schematics for your laptop that
would help.
