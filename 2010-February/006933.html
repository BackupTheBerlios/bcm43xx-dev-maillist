Thanks, I've tested wireless-testing with your pathes and they really increase 
the speed from 8 to 20 Mbps. Great! I used to think that slow speed was the 
problem with the router, not the laptop.

The router is the same as yours, though it runs Tomato 1.27. I've tried to 
disable secure authentication on it and have to admit that the problem is more 
specific than I thought &#8212; 2.6.32 connects to the insecure router without problem 
(though disconnects continue to happen with 2.6.32 after a long period of time, 
not sure about patched wireless-testing). I'll be able to access the unprotected 
network which I fail to connect in a few days (it might be powered by 3Com, not 
sure about that), then I'll try wireless-testing with it.
