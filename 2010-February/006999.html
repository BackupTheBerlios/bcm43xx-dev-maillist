I was hoping someone else would answer your mail, but as no one has come
forward, I will try.

I am not an expert on openWRT. I am using the version of Kamikaze with a 2.4
kernel on a WRT54GL, but the firmware is out of the box.

What I do know is that the BCM4318 does work with WPA/WPA2, although my device
is Cardbus format in an old laptop. Using Broadcom's proprietary firmware, as
you seem to be doing, the encryption/decryption is done in the hardware.

I'm a little confused on your usage of the device. As an AP, I see no need to
scan. Are you using it as a station, or as a wireless bridge? In these modes,
would not the bridging code to eth0 get in the way?

Larry
