<PRE>I didn't try a &quot;cold reboot&quot; that did not involve the removal of
battery and power supply, so maybe it would work.

Honestly I am still perplexed (given modern hardware and software), as
to why/how:
1) Hibernate and un-hibernate, regardless of what happens in between
with the wireless card, could somehow result in it stopping working
2) Rebooting (warm), regardless of how the wireless card is messed up
in my situation does not fix the problem
3) Cold rebooting and warm rebooting are different in any way whatsoever

(all of the above involve zero changes on the hard disk during the
time when the OS is not running)

Is this behavior some sort of &quot;feature&quot; with unintuitive results, or
is it a bug?  And what is the buggy component, exactly?
It seems like something that would happen with early 1990's technology.

Also, are you saying that there is some sort of known problem that
results in you having to &quot;recover the wireless&quot; via a cold-reboot?
What is this problem and is it similar to my situation?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Start the network in Parted Magic again, which this time fails with

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6) Reboot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7) Resume Vista
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 8) At this point, Vista loses connectivity to the wireless network
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 9) Reboot Vista
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 10) Vista still cannot see any wireless networks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 11) Shutdown
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 12) Remove power cord and battery and wait a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 13) Boot Vista, and it now works and sees the network
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As you just eluded to, it seems that the power-down and battery
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removal is necessary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think is the culprit here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have never had to do anything with my netbook to recover the
</I>&gt;<i> wireless with the 2.6.32 kernel other than to shutdown the netbook down
</I>&gt;<i> and then switch the netbook on again. &#160;It has never been necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> disconnect the battery. &#160;A warm reboot however has never been
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient to recover the wireless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not saying that your laptop might not be different, but if you do a
</I>&gt;<i> proper shutdown which actually switches the laptop off followed by a
</I>&gt;<i> switch on (cold boot), rather than a restart (warm boot), then if it
</I>&gt;<i> follows my experience then it should be OK.
