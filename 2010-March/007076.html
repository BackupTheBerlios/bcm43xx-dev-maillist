</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be cool if somebody could compare more registers of the PCI-E

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what's the status on this? I think the fact that the testing patch showed some

</I>&gt;<i> It's also not surprising that something is going wrong there. The whole PCI-E core

</I>&gt;<i> don't have a device that tests it (and probably won't get one anytime soon).
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm really not surprised that there are bugs. There also are missing parts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A bug in the PCI-E core code is able to show such behavior, because all memory
</I>&gt;<i> transfers (MMIO and DMA) from the PCI device to the wireless core are translated
</I>&gt;<i> by the PCI-E core.
</I>&gt;<i> I think the whole PCI-E core code has to be audited (also the specs, probably).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
So if I get this right, this code is responsible of handling the b43
devices, as well as several other PCI-E devices, correct?

Because now that you mention this, the wired network card (Marvel Yukon,
with sky2 drivers) on this netbook also have a tons of issue (doesn't
show in lspci on a clean boot, oops the kernel if network cable is
unplugged while in use, fails to load if the module is ever unloaded, ... )
I thought it was unrelated but from your comment, I feel like this could
be linked to the same PCI-E bugs as well.
