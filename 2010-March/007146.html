Good to hear.

&gt;<i> I did notice that the system log had a very large number of entries like

We don't know why the firmware is generating these errors. In general, they are
harmless.

&gt;<i> However, I do have a question - maybe this isn't the right list to ask, but
</I>&gt;<i> not sure which one would be. We tried a Barnes and Noble store which
</I>&gt;<i> had &quot;free&quot; WiFi access, but I couldn't get it to associate with the AP at
</I>&gt;<i> all. This is one of those setups where it forces your initial browser

</I>&gt;<i> and subsequently the B43 device might have been able to associate. Can

You don't say what distro you are using, nor what kernel. It has been a while
since I connected to an AP using that method, but it worked with openSUSE 11.2
and what was probably a 2.6.32 kernel. With the KDE flavor of NetworkManager's
applet, I created a connection to the AP, then used the applet to connect to it.
Once associated and an IP was obtained with DHCP, I launched the browser, and up
came the sign-in page. This was at a Starbucks where the service was not free,
so I did go any further. Internet access was not that important at the time.
