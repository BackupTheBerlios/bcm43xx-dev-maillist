Everything needed to &quot;generate a file in the firmware directory&quot; are the open()
write() and close() syscalls.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, but that version won't do anything on the SPROM, too.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but if fwcutter were modified, it could write the virtual SPROM file.
</I>
I think it really is abuse of fwcutter.
What if you don't want any proprietary firmware at all, but still want an SPROM image?
What about distros that do _not_ automatically use fwcutter to put proprietary fw in place
for legal reasons? (Which most likely is the majority of distributions).

Why create yet another dependency on fwcutter. I thought the long term plan was to get rid
of proprietary firmware and fwcutter?

Is it really such a big deal for a distribution to include yet another tiny opensource
package? If that really is a problem for a distribution, they should just completely
stop doing their distro.
