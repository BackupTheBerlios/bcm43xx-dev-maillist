</I>&gt;<i> already running.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Use the steps in <A HREF="http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net/802.11/IsSpromAvailable">http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net/802.11/IsSpromAvailable</A> to

</I>&gt;<i> has an 8-bit CRC, thus the validity of the file can be tested even though the
</I>&gt;<i> test is not very robust.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It it reasonable to keep the vendor portion of the MAC and only replace the

</I>
We know that there exist a risk (arguably low) for two devices in the same LAN to have the same 
random part of the MAC. The risk might be higher if, for any reason, the random number generator 
lack good entropy at the time fwcutter is run.

Also, keeping the same MAC prefix (one from Broadcom) will lead to a risk of having the same MAC for 
a randomly generated device and for a legitimate MAC from Broadcom.

To reduce the risk, we can chose two different ways :

1/ Using a &quot;private&quot; MAC (having bit 0x02 of the lowest byte of the MAC set to 1). This will provide 
a random area of 46 bits, far better than 24 bits if we keep the Broadcom prefix.
2/ Registering a public MAC prefix for this usage.

Anyway, I think we should add a duplicate MAC detection system, that would at least issue a warning 
if the NIC lacking an SPROM (and so knowing the MAC address was randomized) receive a packet with 
its MAC as the source MAC.

Of course, in some network topologies, several NIC may share the same MAC, leading to some of them 
receiving packets with their own MAC as source MAC. A bonding configuration is one such situation. 
For this reason, it might be also desirable to have the ability to report to an upper layer that the 
MAC is possibly &quot;unsafe&quot; (subject to a risk of duplicate MAC) and probably not suitable to become 
the shared MAC for a bonding configuration. That way, at the time such configuration are setup, the 
tool used to setup the configuration would have the ability to report the situation to the user.

Also, in order to keep the same MAC if one run fwcutter again, we should provide fwcutter with an 
option to decide whether we want to keep the previously randomized MAC or whether fwcutter should 
provide a new one (in particular if the current one hit a duplicate MAC).
