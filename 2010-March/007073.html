So what's the status on this? I think the fact that the testing patch showed some
improvement is a clear indicator that something in the PCI-E core init is wrong.
It's also not surprising that something is going wrong there. The whole PCI-E core
code basically is undebugged. I wrote most of it long time ago, but I still
don't have a device that tests it (and probably won't get one anytime soon).
So I'm really not surprised that there are bugs. There also are missing parts.

A bug in the PCI-E core code is able to show such behavior, because all memory
transfers (MMIO and DMA) from the PCI device to the wireless core are translated
by the PCI-E core.
I think the whole PCI-E core code has to be audited (also the specs, probably).
