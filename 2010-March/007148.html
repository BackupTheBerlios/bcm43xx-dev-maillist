No, b43 did not corrupt your firmware. The firmware is not contained in
non-volatile memory. With a power-down, it goes away. There is an EEPROM
containing some initial values, but changing that requires specific actions
through the sysfs, and does not happen accidentally. The wl and Windows drivers
have the firmware embedded in the driver. For copyright reasons, we cannot do
that, which is why there is external firmware.

Your DMA error is a known problem with 14e4:4315 devices with Netbooks and some
other systems with Intel processors and a Phoenix BIOS. Again, we have no fix.
With a 2.6.33 kernel, the system will seamlessly switch to PIO mode when the
fatal DMA error occurs.
