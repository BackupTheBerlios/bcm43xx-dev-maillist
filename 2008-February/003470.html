</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Thanks for the info. Perhaps mine will fail 4 times in the next two

</I>&gt;<i>Larry, how do you get a warrenty replacement after you &quot;void&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i>warranty by installing an alternate OS on your HP laptop?
</I>
I don't know how you do it, but when I bought an HP lappy 2 years ago now, I 
put circuit city's manager on notice that they would face me in court if a 
hardware problem showed up, and they refused to honor that extended warranty 
just because they found linux on it.  So far only the lightscribe capable dvd 
drive has failed and it was replaced without question as I left a 20GB 
windows partition bootable so they could run their test tools.  That was one 
of maybe a dozen times xp has ever been booted on that lappy.
