Hmm, unfortunately not. This results in continuous beacon update
interrupts because when both templates are valid we keep them valid all
the time. Hence, it's not usable. I really wonder wtf. is going on. Why
do we even have two beacon templates if we can't mark them both as valid
at the same time? My earlier debugging change marked only the first one
ever valid and that seems to work because the machine is fast enough...

Basically, I think the machine has to always be fast enough to upload a
beacon template within a beacon interval. That's pretty much guaranteed
though so no big deal. I guess the only reason why there are two beacon
templates is the processing latency. When the &quot;beacon template ready
(for modification by host)&quot; interrupt comes in, we might only get to
process it even later than that, and the ucode might need another beacon
rather quickly. It needs to be guaranteed that the ucode has another
beacon before it needs to send one, so the latency must not be higher
than the beacon interval, but that should be fine. If we have to then
change/upload the beacon though, maybe the thinking is that the latency
combined with the template RAM write might be long enough to not allow
uploading the complete beacon again before the next one is needed.
Hence, the ability to upload both and with a just one MMIO read and
write switch to the second one before uploading the first.

I think what we should do is this:

 * we upload both beacon templates whenever we control them and it's
   necessary
 * however, we only mark one of them as hardware valid

Then, when the &quot;beacon template ready (for modification by host)&quot;
interrupt comes in, we check for which one the interrupt came in and
mark the other template as valid immediately. This allows us to mark it
*really* quickly, ie. with just a single MMIO read/write and could be
done even in the interrupt handler itself.

Then, we can lazily see later if we need to change the beacon template
data and upload that without having too much timing pressure. Then, on
the next interrupt, we switch to this one etc.
