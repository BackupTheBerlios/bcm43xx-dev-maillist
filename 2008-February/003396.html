And, I do actually disagree that distributions should switch debugging on.
We should make sure that the driver prints enough error messages in the error
case, so users can see what's going wrong without enabling debugging.
At least as far as external parameters like the firmware are concerned.
That's actually the reason I submitted the patch to add a some driver-load
message, which basically prints out the basic kconfig and required firmware
for the driver. So if someone complains rfkill doesn't work and this line
does not include the &quot;R&quot;, we can easily point him to a to-be-written FAQ
explaining that he needs to enable it in the kernel config.

I'm trying to get user noise down on this list, as it raised since we switched
to b43. Mainly for firmware confusion reasons. But also because Ubuntu udev
is still broken. They should really fix that. It's not only b43 which is &quot;broken&quot;
because of this.

So if somebody has some other idea to reduce the FAQ-noise on this list, please
shout out loud. ;)
