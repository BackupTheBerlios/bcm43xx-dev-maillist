<PRE>Hi all,

I have a strange problem with
my Asus WL-138G V2 (which is AFAIK a BCM4318 non-E card).
It works fine with bcm43xx (since 2.6.22, works with 2.6.24's bcm43xx too), but
not with b43. I can scan without problems
(iwlist scan works, knetworkmanager lists networks properly),
monitor mode works with kismet (both on main interface and on a dedicated
rfmon interface), but I can't associate (authenticate
timeout). Radiotap injection also doesn't work, packetspammer doesn't
complain about errors, but there is nothing actually sent out. Basically,
anything that involves transmitting is broken, while receiving works fine.
I have tried with the following kernel+firmware combos (all 2.6.24 kernels
were opensuse-pae, while the 2.6.24.1 one was opensuse-default, did not try
with a vanilla kernel as I don't want to lose bootsplash and apparmor):
-kernel 2.6.24+firmware 4.80.53 &quot;wl_apsta.o&quot;
-kernel 2.6.24+firmware 4.80.53 &quot;wl_apsta_mimo.o&quot;
-kernel 2.6.24.1+firmware 4.80.53 &quot;wl_apsta.o&quot;
-kernel 2.6.24.1+firmware 4.80.53 &quot;wl_apsta_mimo.o&quot;
-kernel 2.6.24+compat-wireless-2.6+firmware 4.80.53 &quot;wl_apsta.o&quot;
-kernel 2.6.24+compat-wireless-2.6+firmware 4.80.53 &quot;wl_apsta_mimo.o&quot;
-kernel 2.6.24+compat-wireless-2.6+firmware 4.150.10.5 &quot;wl_apsta_mimo.o&quot;
All produced the same error.
I will post my dmesg output if needed, but I can see no error messages from
the driver in it (even though I have enabled b43 and mac80211 debugging in
the compat-wireless config.mk file), only a message about &quot;authentication
timed out&quot;. The message is the same for unencrypted, WEP104 open and
WPA-PSK. I haven't tested WPA-EAP and WPA2-EAP as I don't have the needed
hardware (no RADIUS), but I can test WEP40 open, WEP shared (both 40 and
104),  802.1X, WPA2-PSK and mixed-mode (v1+v2) WPA-PSK. (It might be
interesting that while bcm43xx reported by card power levels as 15dBm,
2.6.24(.1)'s b43 reports it as 27dBm (which is IMHO a bit high, as that
would be 400mW, while the card has an output of about 20mW), and
compat-wireless-2.6's b43 reports 0dBm, yes, 0dBm. That's quite odd. But it
appears that compat-wireless-2.6 is right about the transmit power. :-)
Is this a known bug? What can I do about it?
Thanks,
.NetRolller 3D
